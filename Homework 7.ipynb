       "'CHAPTER I\\r , \\r , TREATS OF THE PLACE WHERE OLIVER TWIST WAS BORN AND OF THE\\r , CIRCUMSTANCES ATTENDING HIS BIRTH\\r , \\r , Among other public buildings in a certain town, which for many reasons\\r , it will be prudent to refrain from mentioning, and to which I will\\r , assign no fictitious name, there is one anciently common to most towns,\\r , great or small: to wit, a workhouse; and in this workhouse was born; on\\r , a day and date which I need not trouble myself to repeat, inasmuch as\\r , it can be of no possible consequence to the reader, in this stage of\\r , the business at all events; the item of mortality whose name is\\r , prefixed to the head of this chapter.\\r , \\r , For a long time after it was ushered into this world of sorrow and\\r , trouble, by the parish surgeon, it remained a matter of considerable\\r , doubt whether the child would survive to bear any name at all; in which\\r , case it is somewhat more than probable that these memoirs would never\\r , have appeared; or, if they had, that being comprised within a couple of\\r , pages, they would have possessed the inestimable merit of being the\\r , most concise and faithful specimen of biography, extant in the\\r , literature of any age or country.\\r , \\r , Although I am not disposed to maintain that the being born in a\\r , workhouse, is in itself the most fortunate and enviable circumstance\\r , that can possibly befall a human being, I do mean to say that in this\\r , particular instance, it was the best thing for Oliver Twist that could\\r , by possibility have occurred.  The fact is, that there was considerable\\r , difficulty in inducing Oliver to take upon himself the office of\\r , respiration,--a troublesome practice, but one which custom has rendered\\r , necessary to our easy existence; and for some time he lay gasping on a\\r , little flock mattress, rather unequally poised between this world and\\r , the next: the balance being decidedly in favour of the latter.  Now,\\r , if, during this brief period, Oliver had been surrounded by careful\\r , grandmothers, anxious aunts, experienced nurses, and doctors of\\r , profound wisdom, he would most inevitably and indubitably have been\\r , killed in no time.  There being nobody by, however, but a pauper old\\r , woman, who was rendered rather misty by an unwonted allowance of beer;\\r , and a parish surgeon who did such matters by contract; Oliver and\\r , Nature fought out the point between them.  The result was, that, after\\r , a few struggles, Oliver breathed, sneezed, and proceeded to advertise\\r , to the inmates of the workhouse the fact of a new burden having been\\r , imposed  upon the parish, by setting up as loud a cry as could\\r , reasonably have been expected from a male infant who had not been\\r , possessed of that very useful appendage, a voice, for a much longer\\r , space of time than three minutes and a quarter.\\r , \\r , As Oliver gave this first proof of the free and proper action of his\\r , lungs, the patchwork coverlet which was carelessly flung over the iron\\r , bedstead, rustled; the pale face of a young woman was raised feebly\\r , from the pillow; and a faint voice imperfectly articulated the words,\\r , \\'Let me see the child, and die.\\'\\r , \\r , The surgeon had been sitting with his face turned towards the fire:\\r , giving the palms of his hands a warm and a rub alternately.  As the\\r , young woman spoke, he rose, and advancing to the bed\\'s head, said, with\\r , more kindness than might have been expected of him:\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, you must not talk about dying yet.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Lor bless her dear heart, no!\\' interposed the nurse, hastily\\r , depositing in her pocket a green glass bottle, the contents of which\\r , she had been tasting in a corner with evident satisfaction.\\r , \\r , \\'Lor bless her dear heart, when she has lived as long as I have, sir,\\r , and had thirteen children of her own, and all on \\'em dead except two,\\r , and them in the wurkus with me, she\\'ll know better than to take on in\\r , that way, bless her dear heart!  Think what it is to be a mother,\\r , there\\'s a dear young lamb do.\\'\\r , \\r , Apparently this consolatory perspective of a mother\\'s prospects failed\\r , in producing its due effect.  The patient shook her head, and stretched\\r , out her hand towards the child.\\r , \\r , The surgeon deposited it in her arms.  She imprinted her cold white\\r , lips passionately on its forehead; passed her hands over her face;\\r , gazed wildly round; shuddered; fell back--and died. They chafed her\\r , breast, hands, and temples; but the blood had stopped forever.  They\\r , talked of hope and comfort. They had been strangers too long.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s all over, Mrs. Thingummy!\\' said the surgeon at last.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah, poor dear, so it is!\\' said the nurse, picking up the cork of the\\r , green bottle, which had fallen out on the pillow, as she stooped to\\r , take up the child.  \\'Poor dear!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You needn\\'t mind sending up to me, if the child cries, nurse,\\' said\\r , the surgeon, putting on his gloves with great deliberation. \\'It\\'s very\\r , likely it _will_ be troublesome. Give it a little gruel if it is.\\'  He\\r , put on his hat, and, pausing by the bed-side on his way to the door,\\r , added, \\'She was a good-looking girl, too; where did she come from?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'She was brought here last night,\\' replied the old woman, \\'by the\\r , overseer\\'s order.  She was found lying in the street.  She had walked\\r , some distance, for her shoes were worn to pieces; but where she came\\r , from, or where she was going to, nobody knows.\\'\\r , \\r , The surgeon leaned over the body, and raised the left hand.  \\'The old\\r , story,\\' he said, shaking his head: \\'no wedding-ring, I see. Ah!\\r , Good-night!\\'\\r , \\r , The medical gentleman walked away to dinner; and the nurse, having once\\r , more applied herself to the green bottle, sat down on a low chair\\r , before the fire, and proceeded to dress the infant.\\r , \\r , What an excellent example of the power of dress, young Oliver Twist\\r , was!  Wrapped in the blanket which had hitherto formed his only\\r , covering, he might have been the child of a nobleman or a beggar; it\\r , would have been hard for the haughtiest stranger to have assigned him\\r , his proper station in society.  But now that he was enveloped in the\\r , old calico robes which had grown yellow in the same service, he was\\r , badged and ticketed, and fell into his place at once--a parish\\r , child--the orphan of a workhouse--the humble, half-starved drudge--to\\r , be cuffed and buffeted through the world--despised by all, and pitied\\r , by none.\\r , \\r , Oliver cried lustily. If he could have known that he was an orphan,\\r , left to the tender mercies of church-wardens and overseers, perhaps he\\r , would have cried the louder.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER II\\r , \\r , TREATS OF OLIVER TWIST\\'S GROWTH, EDUCATION, AND BOARD\\r , \\r , For the next eight or ten months, Oliver was the victim of a systematic\\r , course of treachery and deception.  He was brought up by hand.  The\\r , hungry and destitute situation of the infant orphan was duly reported\\r , by the workhouse authorities to the parish authorities.  The parish\\r , authorities inquired with dignity of the workhouse authorities, whether\\r , there was no female then domiciled in \\'the house\\' who was in a\\r , situation to impart to Oliver Twist, the consolation and nourishment of\\r , which he stood in need.  The workhouse authorities replied with\\r , humility, that there was not. Upon this, the parish authorities\\r , magnanimously and humanely resolved, that Oliver should be \\'farmed,\\'\\r , or, in other words, that he should be dispatched to a branch-workhouse\\r , some three miles off, where twenty or thirty other juvenile offenders\\r , against the poor-laws, rolled about the floor all day, without the\\r , inconvenience of too much food or too much clothing, under the parental\\r , superintendence of an elderly female, who received the culprits at and\\r , for the consideration of sevenpence-halfpenny per small head per week.\\r , Sevenpence-halfpenny\\'s worth per week is a good round diet for a child;\\r , a great deal may be got for sevenpence-halfpenny, quite enough to\\r , overload its stomach, and make it uncomfortable. The elderly female was\\r , a woman of wisdom and experience; she knew what was good for children;\\r , and she had a very accurate perception of what was good for herself.\\r , So, she appropriated the greater part of the weekly stipend to her own\\r , use, and consigned the rising parochial generation to even a shorter\\r , allowance than was originally provided for them.  Thereby finding in\\r , the lowest depth a deeper still; and proving herself a very great\\r , experimental philosopher.\\r , \\r , Everybody knows the story of another experimental philosopher who had a\\r , great theory about a horse being able to live without eating, and who\\r , demonstrated it so well, that he had got his own horse down to a straw\\r , a day, and would unquestionably have rendered him a very spirited and\\r , rampacious animal on nothing at all, if he had not died,\\r , four-and-twenty hours before he was to have had his first comfortable\\r , bait of air.  Unfortunately for, the experimental philosophy of the\\r , female to whose protecting care Oliver Twist was delivered over, a\\r , similar result usually attended the operation of _her_ system; for at\\r , the very moment when the child had contrived to exist upon the smallest\\r , possible portion of the weakest possible food, it did perversely happen\\r , in eight and a half cases out of ten, either that it sickened from want\\r , and cold, or fell into the fire from neglect, or got half-smothered by\\r , accident; in any one of which cases, the miserable little being was\\r , usually summoned into another world, and there gathered to the fathers\\r , it had never known in this.\\r , \\r , Occasionally, when there was some more than usually interesting inquest\\r , upon a parish child who had been overlooked in turning up a bedstead,\\r , or inadvertently scalded to death when there happened to be a\\r , washing--though the latter accident was very scarce, anything\\r , approaching to a washing being of rare occurrence in the farm--the jury\\r , would take it into their heads to ask troublesome questions, or the\\r , parishioners would rebelliously affix their signatures to a\\r , remonstrance.  But these impertinences were speedily checked by the\\r , evidence of the surgeon, and the testimony of the beadle; the former of\\r , whom had always opened the body and found nothing inside (which was\\r , very probable indeed), and the latter of whom invariably swore whatever\\r , the parish wanted; which was very self-devotional.  Besides, the board\\r , made periodical pilgrimages to the farm, and always sent the beadle the\\r , day before, to say they were going.  The children were neat and clean\\r , to behold, when _they_ went; and what more would the people have!\\r , \\r , It cannot be expected that this system of farming would produce any\\r , very extraordinary or luxuriant crop.  Oliver Twist\\'s ninth birthday\\r , found him a pale thin child, somewhat diminutive in stature, and\\r , decidedly small in circumference.  But nature or inheritance had\\r , implanted a good sturdy spirit in Oliver\\'s breast.  It had had plenty\\r , of room to expand, thanks to the spare diet of the establishment; and\\r , perhaps to this circumstance may be attributed his having any ninth\\r , birth-day at all.  Be this as it may, however, it was his ninth\\r , birthday; and he was keeping it in the coal-cellar with a select party\\r , of two other young gentleman, who, after participating with him in a\\r , sound thrashing, had been locked up for atrociously presuming to be\\r , hungry, when Mrs. Mann, the good lady of the house, was unexpectedly\\r , startled by the apparition of Mr. Bumble, the beadle, striving to undo\\r , the wicket of the garden-gate.\\r , \\r , \\'Goodness gracious!  Is that you, Mr. Bumble, sir?\\' said Mrs. Mann,\\r , thrusting her head out of the window in well-affected ecstasies of joy.\\r , \\'(Susan, take Oliver and them two brats upstairs, and wash \\'em\\r , directly.)--My heart alive!  Mr. Bumble, how glad I am to see you,\\r , sure-ly!\\'\\r , \\r , Now, Mr. Bumble was a fat man, and a choleric; so, instead of\\r , responding to this open-hearted salutation in a kindred spirit, he gave\\r , the little wicket a tremendous shake, and then bestowed upon it a kick\\r , which could have emanated from no leg but a beadle\\'s.\\r , \\r , \\'Lor, only think,\\' said Mrs. Mann, running out,--for the three boys had\\r , been removed by this time,--\\'only think of that!  That I should have\\r , forgotten that the gate was bolted on the inside, on account of them\\r , dear children!  Walk in sir; walk in, pray, Mr. Bumble, do, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , Although this invitation was accompanied with a curtsey that might have\\r , softened the heart of a church-warden, it by no means mollified the\\r , beadle.\\r , \\r , \\'Do you think this respectful or proper conduct, Mrs. Mann,\\' inquired\\r , Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane, \\'to keep the parish officers a waiting\\r , at your garden-gate, when they come here upon porochial business with\\r , the porochial orphans?  Are you aweer, Mrs. Mann, that you are, as I\\r , may say, a porochial delegate, and a stipendiary?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'m sure Mr. Bumble, that I was only a telling one or two of the dear\\r , children as is so fond of you, that it was you a coming,\\' replied Mrs.\\r , Mann with great humility.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble had a great idea of his oratorical powers and his\\r , importance.  He had displayed the one, and vindicated the other. He\\r , relaxed.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, well, Mrs. Mann,\\' he replied in a calmer tone; \\'it may be as you\\r , say; it may be.  Lead the way in, Mrs. Mann, for I come on business,\\r , and have something to say.\\'\\r , \\r , Mrs. Mann ushered the beadle into a small parlour with a brick floor;\\r , placed a seat for him; and officiously deposited his cocked hat and\\r , cane on the table before him.  Mr. Bumble wiped from his forehead the\\r , perspiration which his walk had engendered, glanced complacently at the\\r , cocked hat, and smiled.  Yes, he smiled.  Beadles are but men: and Mr.\\r , Bumble smiled.\\r , \\r , \\'Now don\\'t you be offended at what I\\'m a going to say,\\' observed Mrs.\\r , Mann, with captivating sweetness.  \\'You\\'ve had a long walk, you know,\\r , or I wouldn\\'t mention it.  Now, will you take a little drop of\\r , somethink, Mr. Bumble?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not a drop.  Nor a drop,\\' said Mr. Bumble, waving his right hand in a\\r , dignified, but placid manner.\\r , \\r , \\'I think you will,\\' said Mrs. Mann, who had noticed the tone of the\\r , refusal, and the gesture that had accompanied it.  \\'Just a leetle drop,\\r , with a little cold water, and a lump of sugar.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble coughed.\\r , \\r , \\'Now, just a leetle drop,\\' said Mrs. Mann persuasively.\\r , \\r , \\'What is it?\\' inquired the beadle.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, it\\'s what I\\'m obliged to keep a little of in the house, to put\\r , into the blessed infants\\' Daffy, when they ain\\'t well, Mr. Bumble,\\'\\r , replied Mrs. Mann as she opened a corner cupboard, and took down a\\r , bottle and glass.  \\'It\\'s gin.  I\\'ll not deceive you, Mr. B.  It\\'s gin.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Do you give the children Daffy, Mrs. Mann?\\' inquired Bumble, following\\r , with his eyes the interesting process of mixing.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah, bless \\'em, that I do, dear as it is,\\' replied the nurse. \\'I\\r , couldn\\'t see \\'em suffer before my very eyes, you know sir.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No\\'; said Mr. Bumble approvingly; \\'no, you could not.  You are a\\r , humane woman, Mrs. Mann.\\'  (Here she set down the glass.)  \\'I shall\\r , take a early opportunity of mentioning it to the board, Mrs. Mann.\\'\\r , (He drew it towards him.)  \\'You feel as a mother, Mrs. Mann.\\'  (He\\r , stirred the gin-and-water.) \\'I--I drink your health with cheerfulness,\\r , Mrs. Mann\\'; and he swallowed half of it.\\r , \\r , \\'And now about business,\\' said the beadle, taking out a leathern\\r , pocket-book.  \\'The child that was half-baptized Oliver Twist, is nine\\r , year old to-day.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Bless him!\\' interposed Mrs. Mann, inflaming her left eye with the\\r , corner of her apron.\\r , \\r , \\'And notwithstanding a offered reward of ten pound, which was\\r , afterwards increased to twenty pound.  Notwithstanding the most\\r , superlative, and, I may say, supernat\\'ral exertions on the part of this\\r , parish,\\' said Bumble, \\'we have never been able to discover who is his\\r , father, or what was his mother\\'s settlement, name, or condition.\\'\\r , \\r , Mrs. Mann raised her hands in astonishment; but added, after a moment\\'s\\r , reflection, \\'How comes he to have any name at all, then?\\'\\r , \\r , The beadle drew himself up with great pride, and said, \\'I inwented it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You, Mr. Bumble!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I, Mrs. Mann.  We name our fondlings in alphabetical order. The last\\r , was a S,--Swubble, I named him. This was a T,--Twist, I named _him_.\\r , The next one comes will be Unwin, and the next Vilkins.  I have got\\r , names ready made to the end of the alphabet, and all the way through it\\r , again, when we come to Z.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why, you\\'re quite a literary character, sir!\\' said Mrs. Mann.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, well,\\' said the beadle, evidently gratified with the compliment;\\r , \\'perhaps I may be.  Perhaps I may be, Mrs. Mann.\\' He finished the\\r , gin-and-water, and added, \\'Oliver being now too old to remain here, the\\r , board have determined to have him back into the house.  I have come out\\r , myself to take him there.  So let me see him at once.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ll fetch him directly,\\' said Mrs. Mann, leaving the room for that\\r , purpose.  Oliver, having had by this time as much of the outer coat of\\r , dirt which encrusted his face and hands, removed, as could be scrubbed\\r , off in one washing, was led into the room by his benevolent protectress.\\r , \\r , \\'Make a bow to the gentleman, Oliver,\\' said Mrs. Mann.\\r , \\r , Oliver made a bow, which was divided between the beadle on the chair,\\r , and the cocked hat on the table.\\r , \\r , \\'Will you go along with me, Oliver?\\' said Mr. Bumble, in a majestic\\r , voice.\\r , \\r , Oliver was about to say that he would go along with anybody with great\\r , readiness, when, glancing upward, he caught sight of Mrs. Mann, who had\\r , got behind the beadle\\'s chair, and was shaking her fist at him with a\\r , furious countenance.  He took the hint at once, for the fist had been\\r , too often impressed upon his body not to be deeply impressed upon his\\r , recollection.\\r , \\r , \\'Will she go with me?\\' inquired poor Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'No, she can\\'t,\\' replied Mr. Bumble.  \\'But she\\'ll come and see you\\r , sometimes.\\'\\r , \\r , This was no very great consolation to the child.  Young as he was,\\r , however, he had sense enough to make a feint of feeling great regret at\\r , going away.  It was no very difficult matter for the boy to call tears\\r , into his eyes.  Hunger and recent ill-usage are great assistants if you\\r , want to cry; and Oliver cried very naturally indeed.  Mrs. Mann gave\\r , him a thousand embraces, and what Oliver wanted a great deal more, a\\r , piece of bread and butter, less he should seem too hungry when he got\\r , to the workhouse. With the slice of bread in his hand, and the little\\r , brown-cloth parish cap on his head, Oliver was then led away by Mr.\\r , Bumble from the wretched home where one kind word or look had never\\r , lighted the gloom of his infant years.  And yet he burst into an agony\\r , of childish grief, as the cottage-gate closed after him.  Wretched as\\r , were the little companions in misery he was leaving behind, they were\\r , the only friends he had ever known; and a sense of his loneliness in\\r , the great wide world, sank into the child\\'s heart for the first time.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble walked on with long strides; little Oliver, firmly grasping\\r , his gold-laced cuff, trotted beside him, inquiring at the end of every\\r , quarter of a mile whether they were \\'nearly there.\\' To these\\r , interrogations Mr. Bumble returned very brief and snappish replies; for\\r , the temporary blandness which gin-and-water awakens in some bosoms had\\r , by this time evaporated; and he was once again a beadle.\\r , \\r , Oliver had not been within the walls of the workhouse a quarter of an\\r , hour, and had scarcely completed the demolition of a second slice of\\r , bread, when Mr. Bumble, who had handed him over to the care of an old\\r , woman, returned; and, telling him it was a board night, informed him\\r , that the board had said he was to appear before it forthwith.\\r , \\r , Not having a very clearly defined notion of what a live board was,\\r , Oliver was rather astounded by this intelligence, and was not quite\\r , certain whether he ought to laugh or cry.  He had no time to think\\r , about the matter, however; for Mr. Bumble gave him a tap on the head,\\r , with his cane, to wake him up: and another on the back to make him\\r , lively: and bidding him to follow, conducted him into a large\\r , white-washed room, where eight or ten fat gentlemen were sitting round\\r , a table.  At the top of the table, seated in an arm-chair rather higher\\r , than the rest, was a particularly fat gentleman with a very round, red\\r , face.\\r , \\r , \\'Bow to the board,\\' said Bumble.  Oliver brushed away two or three\\r , tears that were lingering in his eyes; and seeing no board but the\\r , table, fortunately bowed to that.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s your name, boy?\\' said the gentleman in the high chair.\\r , \\r , Oliver was frightened at the sight of so many gentlemen, which made him\\r , tremble: and the beadle gave him another tap behind, which made him\\r , cry.  These two causes made him answer in a very low and hesitating\\r , voice; whereupon a gentleman in a white waistcoat said he was a fool.\\r , Which was a capital way of raising his spirits, and putting him quite\\r , at his ease.\\r , \\r , \\'Boy,\\' said the gentleman in the high chair, \\'listen to me. You know\\r , you\\'re an orphan, I suppose?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s that, sir?\\' inquired poor Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'The boy _is_ a fool--I thought he was,\\' said the gentleman in the\\r , white waistcoat.\\r , \\r , \\'Hush!\\' said the gentleman who had spoken first.  \\'You know you\\'ve got\\r , no father or mother, and that you were brought up by the parish, don\\'t\\r , you?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, sir,\\' replied Oliver, weeping bitterly.\\r , \\r , \\'What are you crying for?\\' inquired the gentleman in the white\\r , waistcoat.  And to be sure it was very extraordinary.  What _could_ the\\r , boy be crying for?\\r , \\r , \\'I hope you say your prayers every night,\\' said another gentleman in a\\r , gruff voice; \\'and pray for the people who feed you, and take care of\\r , you--like a Christian.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, sir,\\' stammered the boy.  The gentleman who spoke last was\\r , unconsciously right.  It would have been very like a Christian, and a\\r , marvellously good Christian too, if Oliver had prayed for the people\\r , who fed and took care of _him_. But he hadn\\'t, because nobody had\\r , taught him.\\r , \\r , \\'Well!  You have come here to be educated, and taught a useful trade,\\'\\r , said the red-faced gentleman in the high chair.\\r , \\r , \\'So you\\'ll begin to pick oakum to-morrow morning at six o\\'clock,\\' added\\r , the surly one in the white waistcoat.\\r , \\r , For the combination of both these blessings in the one simple process\\r , of picking oakum, Oliver bowed low by the direction of the beadle, and\\r , was then hurried away to a large ward; where, on a rough, hard bed, he\\r , sobbed himself to sleep.  What a novel illustration of the tender laws\\r , of England!  They let the paupers go to sleep!\\r , \\r , Poor Oliver!  He little thought, as he lay sleeping in happy\\r , unconsciousness of all around him, that the board had that very day\\r , arrived at a decision which would exercise the most material influence\\r , over all his future fortunes.  But they had.  And this was it:\\r , \\r , The members of this board were very sage, deep, philosophical men; and\\r , when they came to turn their attention to the workhouse, they found out\\r , at once, what ordinary folks would never have discovered--the poor\\r , people liked it!  It was a regular place of public entertainment for\\r , the poorer classes; a tavern where there was nothing to pay; a public\\r , breakfast, dinner, tea, and supper all the year round; a brick and\\r , mortar elysium, where it was all play and no work.  \\'Oho!\\' said the\\r , board, looking very knowing; \\'we are the fellows to set this to rights;\\r , we\\'ll stop it all, in no time.\\'  So, they established the rule, that\\r , all poor people should have the alternative (for they would compel\\r , nobody, not they), of being starved by a gradual process in the house,\\r , or by a quick one out of it.  With this view, they contracted with the\\r , water-works to lay on an unlimited supply of water; and with a\\r , corn-factor to supply periodically small quantities of oatmeal; and\\r , issued three meals of thin gruel a day, with an onion twice a week, and\\r , half a roll of Sundays.  They made a great many other wise and humane\\r , regulations, having reference to the ladies, which it is not necessary\\r , to repeat; kindly undertook to divorce poor married people, in\\r , consequence of the great expense of a suit in Doctors\\' Commons; and,\\r , instead of compelling a man to support his family, as they had\\r , theretofore done, took his family away from him, and made him a\\r , bachelor!  There is no saying how many applicants for relief, under\\r , these last two heads, might have started up in all classes of society,\\r , if it had not been coupled with the workhouse; but the board were\\r , long-headed men, and had provided for this difficulty.  The relief was\\r , inseparable from the workhouse and the gruel; and that frightened\\r , people.\\r , \\r , For the first six months after Oliver Twist was removed, the system was\\r , in full operation.  It was rather expensive at first, in consequence of\\r , the increase in the undertaker\\'s bill, and the necessity of taking in\\r , the clothes of all the paupers, which fluttered loosely on their\\r , wasted, shrunken forms, after a week or two\\'s gruel.  But the number of\\r , workhouse inmates got thin as well as the paupers; and the board were\\r , in ecstasies.\\r , \\r , The room in which the boys were fed, was a large stone hall, with a\\r , copper at one end: out of which the master, dressed in an apron for the\\r , purpose, and assisted by one or two women, ladled the gruel at\\r , mealtimes.  Of this festive composition each boy had one porringer, and\\r , no more--except on occasions of great public rejoicing, when he had two\\r , ounces and a quarter of bread besides.\\r , \\r , The bowls never wanted washing.  The boys polished them with their\\r , spoons till they shone again; and when they had performed this\\r , operation (which never took very long, the spoons being nearly as large\\r , as the bowls), they would sit staring at the copper, with such eager\\r , eyes, as if they could have devoured the very bricks of which it was\\r , composed; employing themselves, meanwhile, in sucking their fingers\\r , most assiduously, with the view of catching up any stray splashes of\\r , gruel that might have been cast thereon.  Boys have generally excellent\\r , appetites. Oliver Twist and his companions suffered the tortures of\\r , slow starvation for three months: at last they got so voracious and\\r , wild with hunger, that one boy, who was tall for his age, and hadn\\'t\\r , been used to that sort of thing (for his father had kept a small\\r , cook-shop), hinted darkly to his companions, that unless he had another\\r , basin of gruel per diem, he was afraid he might some night happen to\\r , eat the boy who slept next him, who happened to be a weakly youth of\\r , tender age.  He had a wild, hungry eye; and they implicitly believed\\r , him. A council was held; lots were cast who should walk up to the\\r , master after supper that evening, and ask for more; and it fell to\\r , Oliver Twist.\\r , \\r , The evening arrived; the boys took their places.  The master, in his\\r , cook\\'s uniform, stationed himself at the copper; his pauper assistants\\r , ranged themselves behind him; the gruel was served out; and a long\\r , grace was said over the short commons.  The gruel disappeared; the boys\\r , whispered each other, and winked at Oliver; while his next neighbors\\r , nudged him.  Child as he was, he was desperate with hunger, and\\r , reckless with misery.  He rose from the table; and advancing to the\\r , master, basin and spoon in hand, said: somewhat alarmed at his own\\r , temerity:\\r , \\r , \\'Please, sir, I want some more.\\'\\r , \\r , The master was a fat, healthy man; but he turned very pale. He gazed in\\r , stupefied astonishment on the small rebel for some seconds, and then\\r , clung for support to the copper.  The assistants were paralysed with\\r , wonder; the boys with fear.\\r , \\r , \\'What!\\' said the master at length, in a faint voice.\\r , \\r , \\'Please, sir,\\' replied Oliver, \\'I want some more.\\'\\r , \\r , The master aimed a blow at Oliver\\'s head with the ladle; pinioned him\\r , in his arm; and shrieked aloud for the beadle.\\r , \\r , The board were sitting in solemn conclave, when Mr. Bumble rushed into\\r , the room in great excitement, and addressing the gentleman in the high\\r , chair, said,\\r , \\r , \\'Mr. Limbkins, I beg your pardon, sir!  Oliver Twist has asked for\\r , more!\\'\\r , \\r , There was a general start.  Horror was depicted on every countenance.\\r , \\r , \\'For _more_!\\' said Mr. Limbkins.  \\'Compose yourself, Bumble, and answer\\r , me distinctly.  Do I understand that he asked for more, after he had\\r , eaten the supper allotted by the dietary?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He did, sir,\\' replied Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'That boy will be hung,\\' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.  \\'I\\r , know that boy will be hung.\\'\\r , \\r , Nobody controverted the prophetic gentleman\\'s opinion.  An animated\\r , discussion took place.  Oliver was ordered into instant confinement;\\r , and a bill was next morning pasted on the outside of the gate, offering\\r , a reward of five pounds to anybody who would take Oliver Twist off the\\r , hands of the parish.  In other words, five pounds and Oliver Twist were\\r , offered to any man or woman who wanted an apprentice to any trade,\\r , business, or calling.\\r , \\r , \\'I never was more convinced of anything in my life,\\' said the gentleman\\r , in the white waistcoat, as he knocked at the gate and read the bill\\r , next morning: \\'I never was more convinced of anything in my life, than\\r , I am that that boy will come to be hung.\\'\\r , \\r , As I purpose to show in the sequel whether the white waistcoated\\r , gentleman was right or not, I should perhaps mar the interest of this\\r , narrative (supposing it to possess any at all), if I ventured to hint\\r , just yet, whether the life of Oliver Twist had this violent termination\\r , or no.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER III\\r , \\r , RELATES HOW OLIVER TWIST WAS VERY NEAR GETTING A PLACE WHICH WOULD NOT\\r , HAVE BEEN A SINECURE\\r , \\r , For a week after the commission of the impious and profane offence of\\r , asking for more, Oliver remained a close prisoner in the dark and\\r , solitary room to which he had been consigned by the wisdom and mercy of\\r , the board.  It appears, at first sight not unreasonable to suppose,\\r , that, if he had entertained a becoming feeling of respect for the\\r , prediction of the gentleman in the white waistcoat, he would have\\r , established that sage individual\\'s prophetic character, once and for\\r , ever, by tying one end of his pocket-handkerchief to a hook in the\\r , wall, and attaching himself to the other.  To the performance of this\\r , feat, however, there was one obstacle: namely, that\\r , pocket-handkerchiefs being decided articles of luxury, had been, for\\r , all future times and ages, removed from the noses of paupers by the\\r , express order of the board, in council assembled: solemnly given and\\r , pronounced under their hands and seals.  There was a still greater\\r , obstacle in Oliver\\'s youth and childishness.  He only cried bitterly\\r , all day; and, when the long, dismal night came on, spread his little\\r , hands before his eyes to shut out the darkness, and crouching in the\\r , corner, tried to sleep: ever and anon waking with a start and tremble,\\r , and drawing himself closer and closer to the wall, as if to feel even\\r , its cold hard surface were a protection in the gloom and loneliness\\r , which surrounded him.\\r , \\r , Let it not be supposed by the enemies of \\'the system,\\' that, during the\\r , period of his solitary incarceration, Oliver was denied the benefit of\\r , exercise, the pleasure of society, or the advantages of religious\\r , consolation.  As for exercise, it was nice cold weather, and he was\\r , allowed to perform his ablutions every morning under the pump, in a\\r , stone yard, in the presence of Mr. Bumble, who prevented his catching\\r , cold, and caused a tingling sensation to pervade his frame, by repeated\\r , applications of the cane.  As for society, he was carried every other\\r , day into the hall where the boys dined, and there sociably flogged as a\\r , public warning and example.  And so far from being denied the\\r , advantages of religious consolation, he was kicked into the same\\r , apartment every evening at prayer-time, and there permitted to listen\\r , to, and console his mind with, a general supplication of the boys,\\r , containing a special clause, therein inserted by authority of the\\r , board, in which they entreated to be made good, virtuous, contented,\\r , and obedient, and to be guarded from the sins and vices of Oliver\\r , Twist: whom the supplication distinctly set forth to be under the\\r , exclusive patronage and protection of the powers of wickedness, and an\\r , article direct from the manufactory of the very Devil himself.\\r , \\r , It chanced one morning, while Oliver\\'s affairs were in this auspicious\\r , and comfortable state, that Mr. Gamfield, chimney-sweep, went his way\\r , down the High Street, deeply cogitating in his mind his ways and means\\r , of paying certain arrears of rent, for which his landlord had become\\r , rather pressing.  Mr. Gamfield\\'s most sanguine estimate of his finances\\r , could not raise them within full five pounds of the desired amount;\\r , and, in a species of arithmetical desperation, he was alternately\\r , cudgelling his brains and his donkey, when passing the workhouse, his\\r , eyes encountered the bill on the gate.\\r , \\r , \\'Wo--o!\\' said Mr. Gamfield to the donkey.\\r , \\r , The donkey was in a state of profound abstraction: wondering, probably,\\r , whether he was destined to be regaled with a cabbage-stalk or two when\\r , he had disposed of the two sacks of soot with which the little cart was\\r , laden; so, without noticing the word of command, he jogged onward.\\r , \\r , Mr. Gamfield growled a fierce imprecation on the donkey generally, but\\r , more particularly on his eyes; and, running after him, bestowed a blow\\r , on his head, which would inevitably have beaten in any skull but a\\r , donkey\\'s.  Then, catching hold of the bridle, he gave his jaw a sharp\\r , wrench, by way of gentle reminder that he was not his own master; and\\r , by these means turned him round.  He then gave him another blow on the\\r , head, just to stun him till he came back again.  Having completed these\\r , arrangements, he walked up to the gate, to read the bill.\\r , \\r , The gentleman with the white waistcoat was standing at the gate with\\r , his hands behind him, after having delivered himself of some profound\\r , sentiments in the board-room.  Having witnessed the little dispute\\r , between Mr. Gamfield and the donkey, he smiled joyously when that\\r , person came up to read the bill, for he saw at once that Mr. Gamfield\\r , was exactly the sort of master Oliver Twist wanted.  Mr. Gamfield\\r , smiled, too, as he perused the document; for five pounds was just the\\r , sum he had been wishing for; and, as to the boy with which it was\\r , encumbered, Mr. Gamfield, knowing what the dietary of the workhouse\\r , was, well knew he would be a nice small pattern, just the very thing\\r , for register stoves.  So, he spelt the bill through again, from\\r , beginning to end; and then, touching his fur cap in token of humility,\\r , accosted the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\\r , \\r , \\'This here boy, sir, wot the parish wants to \\'prentis,\\' said Mr.\\r , Gamfield.\\r , \\r , \\'Ay, my man,\\' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat, with a\\r , condescending smile.  \\'What of him?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If the parish vould like him to learn a right pleasant trade, in a\\r , good \\'spectable chimbley-sweepin\\' bisness,\\' said Mr. Gamfield, \\'I wants\\r , a \\'prentis, and I am ready to take him.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Walk in,\\' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.  Mr. Gamfield\\r , having lingered behind, to give the donkey another blow on the head,\\r , and another wrench of the jaw, as a caution not to run away in his\\r , absence, followed the gentleman with the white waistcoat into the room\\r , where Oliver had first seen him.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s a nasty trade,\\' said Mr. Limbkins, when Gamfield had again stated\\r , his wish.\\r , \\r , \\'Young boys have been smothered in chimneys before now,\\' said another\\r , gentleman.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s acause they damped the straw afore they lit it in the chimbley\\r , to make \\'em come down again,\\' said Gamfield; \\'that\\'s all smoke, and no\\r , blaze; vereas smoke ain\\'t o\\' no use at all in making a boy come down,\\r , for it only sinds him to sleep, and that\\'s wot he likes.  Boys is wery\\r , obstinit, and wery lazy, Gen\\'l\\'men, and there\\'s nothink like a good hot\\r , blaze to make \\'em come down vith a run.  It\\'s humane too, gen\\'l\\'men,\\r , acause, even if they\\'ve stuck in the chimbley, roasting their feet\\r , makes \\'em struggle to hextricate theirselves.\\'\\r , \\r , The gentleman in the white waistcoat appeared very much amused by this\\r , explanation; but his mirth was speedily checked by a look from Mr.\\r , Limbkins.  The board then proceeded to converse among themselves for a\\r , few minutes, but in so low a tone, that the words \\'saving of\\r , expenditure,\\' \\'looked well in the accounts,\\' \\'have a printed report\\r , published,\\' were alone audible.  These only chanced to be heard,\\r , indeed, or account of their being very frequently repeated with great\\r , emphasis.\\r , \\r , At length the whispering ceased; and the members of the board, having\\r , resumed their seats and their solemnity, Mr. Limbkins said:\\r , \\r , \\'We have considered your proposition, and we don\\'t approve of it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not at all,\\' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\\r , \\r , \\'Decidedly not,\\' added the other members.\\r , \\r , As Mr. Gamfield did happen to labour under the slight imputation of\\r , having bruised three or four boys to death already, it occurred to him\\r , that the board had, perhaps, in some unaccountable freak, taken it into\\r , their heads that this extraneous circumstance ought to influence their\\r , proceedings. It was very unlike their general mode of doing business,\\r , if they had; but still, as he had no particular wish to revive the\\r , rumour, he twisted his cap in his hands, and walked slowly from the\\r , table.\\r , \\r , \\'So you won\\'t let me have him, gen\\'l\\'men?\\' said Mr. Gamfield, pausing\\r , near the door.\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' replied Mr. Limbkins; \\'at least, as it\\'s a nasty business, we\\r , think you ought to take something less than the premium we offered.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Gamfield\\'s countenance brightened, as, with a quick step, he\\r , returned to the table, and said,\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'ll you give, gen\\'l\\'men?  Come!  Don\\'t be too hard on a poor man.\\r , What\\'ll you give?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I should say, three pound ten was plenty,\\' said Mr. Limbkins.\\r , \\r , \\'Ten shillings too much,\\' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\\r , \\r , \\'Come!\\' said Gamfield; \\'say four pound, gen\\'l\\'men.  Say four pound, and\\r , you\\'ve got rid of him for good and all.  There!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Three pound ten,\\' repeated Mr. Limbkins, firmly.\\r , \\r , \\'Come!  I\\'ll split the diff\\'erence, gen\\'l\\'men,\\' urged Gamfield. \\'Three\\r , pound fifteen.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not a farthing more,\\' was the firm reply of Mr. Limbkins.\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'re desperate hard upon me, gen\\'l\\'men,\\' said Gamfield, wavering.\\r , \\r , \\'Pooh!  pooh!  nonsense!\\' said the gentleman in the white waistcoat.\\r , \\'He\\'d be cheap with nothing at all, as a premium. Take him, you silly\\r , fellow!  He\\'s just the boy for you.  He wants the stick, now and then:\\r , it\\'ll do him good; and his board needn\\'t come very expensive, for he\\r , hasn\\'t been overfed since he was born.  Ha!  ha!  ha!\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Gamfield gave an arch look at the faces round the table, and,\\r , observing a smile on all of them, gradually broke into a smile himself.\\r , The bargain was made.  Mr. Bumble, was at once instructed that Oliver\\r , Twist and his indentures were to be conveyed before the magistrate, for\\r , signature and approval, that very afternoon.\\r , \\r , In pursuance of this determination, little Oliver, to his excessive\\r , astonishment, was released from bondage, and ordered to put himself\\r , into a clean shirt.  He had hardly achieved this very unusual gymnastic\\r , performance, when Mr. Bumble brought him, with his own hands, a basin\\r , of gruel, and the holiday allowance of two ounces and a quarter of\\r , bread. At this tremendous sight, Oliver began to cry very piteously:\\r , thinking, not unnaturally, that the board must have determined to kill\\r , him for some useful purpose, or they never would have begun to fatten\\r , him up in that way.\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t make your eyes red, Oliver, but eat your food and be thankful,\\'\\r , said Mr. Bumble, in a tone of impressive pomposity. \\'You\\'re a going to\\r , be made a \\'prentice of, Oliver.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'A prentice, sir!\\' said the child, trembling.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, Oliver,\\' said Mr. Bumble.  \\'The kind and blessed gentleman which\\r , is so many parents to you, Oliver, when you have none of your own: are\\r , a going to \\'prentice\\' you: and to set you up in life, and make a man of\\r , you: although the expense to the parish is three pound ten!--three\\r , pound ten, Oliver!--seventy shillins--one hundred and forty\\r , sixpences!--and all for a naughty orphan which nobody can\\'t love.\\'\\r , \\r , As Mr. Bumble paused to take breath, after delivering this address in\\r , an awful voice, the tears rolled down the poor child\\'s face, and he\\r , sobbed bitterly.\\r , \\r , \\'Come,\\' said Mr. Bumble, somewhat less pompously, for it was gratifying\\r , to his feelings to observe the effect his eloquence had produced;\\r , \\'Come, Oliver!  Wipe your eyes with the cuffs of your jacket, and don\\'t\\r , cry into your gruel; that\\'s a very foolish action, Oliver.\\'  It\\r , certainly was, for there was quite enough water in it already.\\r , \\r , On their way to the magistrate, Mr. Bumble instructed Oliver that all\\r , he would have to do, would be to look very happy, and say, when the\\r , gentleman asked him if he wanted to be apprenticed, that he should like\\r , it very much indeed; both of which injunctions Oliver promised to obey:\\r , the rather as Mr. Bumble threw in a gentle hint, that if he failed in\\r , either particular, there was no telling what would be done to him. When\\r , they arrived at the office, he was shut up in a little room by himself,\\r , and admonished by Mr. Bumble to stay there, until he came back to fetch\\r , him.\\r , \\r , There the boy remained, with a palpitating heart, for half an hour.  At\\r , the expiration of which time Mr. Bumble thrust in his head, unadorned\\r , with the cocked hat, and said aloud:\\r , \\r , \\'Now, Oliver, my dear, come to the gentleman.\\'  As Mr. Bumble said\\r , this, he put on a grim and threatening look, and added, in a low voice,\\r , \\'Mind what I told you, you young rascal!\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver stared innocently in Mr. Bumble\\'s face at this somewhat\\r , contradictory style of address; but that gentleman prevented his\\r , offering any remark thereupon, by leading him at once into an adjoining\\r , room: the door of which was open. It was a large room, with a great\\r , window.  Behind a desk, sat two old gentleman with powdered heads: one\\r , of whom was reading the newspaper; while the other was perusing, with\\r , the aid of a pair of tortoise-shell spectacles, a small piece of\\r , parchment which lay before him.  Mr. Limbkins was standing in front of\\r , the desk on one side; and Mr. Gamfield, with a partially washed face,\\r , on the other; while two or three bluff-looking men, in top-boots, were\\r , lounging about.\\r , \\r , The old gentleman with the spectacles gradually dozed off, over the\\r , little bit of parchment; and there was a short pause, after Oliver had\\r , been stationed by Mr. Bumble in front of the desk.\\r , \\r , \\'This is the boy, your worship,\\' said Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , The old gentleman who was reading the newspaper raised his head for a\\r , moment, and pulled the other old gentleman by the sleeve; whereupon,\\r , the last-mentioned old gentleman woke up.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, is this the boy?\\' said the old gentleman.\\r , \\r , \\'This is him, sir,\\' replied Mr. Bumble.  \\'Bow to the magistrate, my\\r , dear.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver roused himself, and made his best obeisance.  He had been\\r , wondering, with his eyes fixed on the magistrates\\' powder, whether all\\r , boards were born with that white stuff on their heads, and were boards\\r , from thenceforth on that account.\\r , \\r , \\'Well,\\' said the old gentleman, \\'I suppose he\\'s fond of\\r , chimney-sweeping?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He doats on it, your worship,\\' replied Bumble; giving Oliver a sly\\r , pinch, to intimate that he had better not say he didn\\'t.\\r , \\r , \\'And he _will_ be a sweep, will he?\\' inquired the old gentleman.\\r , \\r , \\'If we was to bind him to any other trade to-morrow, he\\'d run away\\r , simultaneous, your worship,\\' replied Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'And this man that\\'s to be his master--you, sir--you\\'ll treat him well,\\r , and feed him, and do all that sort of thing, will you?\\' said the old\\r , gentleman.\\r , \\r , \\'When I says I will, I means I will,\\' replied Mr. Gamfield doggedly.\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'re a rough speaker, my friend, but you look an honest,\\r , open-hearted man,\\' said the old gentleman: turning his spectacles in\\r , the direction of the candidate for Oliver\\'s premium, whose villainous\\r , countenance was a regular stamped receipt for cruelty.  But the\\r , magistrate was half blind and half childish, so he couldn\\'t reasonably\\r , be expected to discern what other people did.\\r , \\r , \\'I hope I am, sir,\\' said Mr. Gamfield, with an ugly leer.\\r , \\r , \\'I have no doubt you are, my friend,\\' replied the old gentleman: fixing\\r , his spectacles more firmly on his nose, and looking about him for the\\r , inkstand.\\r , \\r , It was the critical moment of Oliver\\'s fate.  If the inkstand had been\\r , where the old gentleman thought it was, he would have dipped his pen\\r , into it, and signed the indentures, and Oliver would have been\\r , straightway hurried off.  But, as it chanced to be immediately under\\r , his nose, it followed, as a matter of course, that he looked all over\\r , his desk for it, without finding it; and happening in the course of his\\r , search to look straight before him, his gaze encountered the pale and\\r , terrified face of Oliver Twist: who, despite all the admonitory looks\\r , and pinches of Bumble, was regarding the repulsive countenance of his\\r , future master, with a mingled expression of horror and fear, too\\r , palpable to be mistaken, even by a half-blind magistrate.\\r , \\r , The old gentleman stopped, laid down his pen, and looked from Oliver to\\r , Mr. Limbkins; who attempted to take snuff with a cheerful and\\r , unconcerned aspect.\\r , \\r , \\'My boy!\\' said the old gentleman, \\'you look pale and alarmed. What is\\r , the matter?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Stand a little away from him, Beadle,\\' said the other magistrate:\\r , laying aside the paper, and leaning forward with an expression of\\r , interest.  \\'Now, boy, tell us what\\'s the matter: don\\'t be afraid.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver fell on his knees, and clasping his hands together, prayed that\\r , they would order him back to the dark room--that they would starve\\r , him--beat him--kill him if they pleased--rather than send him away with\\r , that dreadful man.\\r , \\r , \\'Well!\\' said Mr. Bumble, raising his hands and eyes with most\\r , impressive solemnity.  \\'Well! of all the artful and designing orphans\\r , that ever I see, Oliver, you are one of the most bare-facedest.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hold your tongue, Beadle,\\' said the second old gentleman, when Mr.\\r , Bumble had given vent to this compound adjective.\\r , \\r , \\'I beg your worship\\'s pardon,\\' said Mr. Bumble, incredulous of having\\r , heard aright.  \\'Did your worship speak to me?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes.  Hold your tongue.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble was stupefied with astonishment.  A beadle ordered to hold\\r , his tongue!  A moral revolution!\\r , \\r , The old gentleman in the tortoise-shell spectacles looked at his\\r , companion, he nodded significantly.\\r , \\r , \\'We refuse to sanction these indentures,\\' said the old gentleman:\\r , tossing aside the piece of parchment as he spoke.\\r , \\r , \\'I hope,\\' stammered Mr. Limbkins:  \\'I hope the magistrates will not\\r , form the opinion that the authorities have been guilty of any improper\\r , conduct, on the unsupported testimony of a child.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The magistrates are not called upon to pronounce any opinion on the\\r , matter,\\' said the second old gentleman sharply.  \\'Take the boy back to\\r , the workhouse, and treat him kindly.  He seems to want it.\\'\\r , \\r , That same evening, the gentleman in the white waistcoat most positively\\r , and decidedly affirmed, not only that Oliver would be hung, but that he\\r , would be drawn and quartered into the bargain. Mr. Bumble shook his\\r , head with gloomy mystery, and said he wished he might come to good;\\r , whereunto Mr. Gamfield replied, that he wished he might come to him;\\r , which, although he agreed with the beadle in most matters, would seem\\r , to be a wish of a totally opposite description.\\r , \\r , The next morning, the public were once informed that Oliver Twist was\\r , again To Let, and that five pounds would be paid to anybody who would\\r , take possession of him.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER IV\\r , \\r , OLIVER, BEING OFFERED ANOTHER PLACE, MAKES HIS FIRST ENTRY INTO PUBLIC\\r , LIFE\\r , \\r , In great families, when an advantageous place cannot be obtained,\\r , either in possession, reversion, remainder, or expectancy, for the\\r , young man who is growing up, it is a very general custom to send him to\\r , sea.  The board, in imitation of so wise and salutary an example, took\\r , counsel together on the expediency of shipping off Oliver Twist, in\\r , some small trading vessel bound to a good unhealthy port.  This\\r , suggested itself as the very best thing that could possibly be done\\r , with him: the probability being, that the skipper would flog him to\\r , death, in a playful mood, some day after dinner, or would knock his\\r , brains out with an iron bar; both pastimes being, as is pretty\\r , generally known, very favourite and common recreations among gentleman\\r , of that class.  The more the case presented itself to the board, in\\r , this point of view, the more manifold the advantages of the step\\r , appeared; so, they came to the conclusion that the only way of\\r , providing for Oliver effectually, was to send him to sea without delay.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble had been despatched to make various preliminary inquiries,\\r , with the view of finding out some captain or other who wanted a\\r , cabin-boy without any friends; and was returning to the workhouse to\\r , communicate the result of his mission; when he encountered at the gate,\\r , no less a person than Mr. Sowerberry, the parochial undertaker.\\r , \\r , Mr. Sowerberry was a tall gaunt, large-jointed man, attired in a suit\\r , of threadbare black, with darned cotton stockings of the same colour,\\r , and shoes to answer.  His features were not naturally intended to wear\\r , a smiling aspect, but he was in general rather given to professional\\r , jocosity.  His step was elastic, and his face betokened inward\\r , pleasantry, as he advanced to Mr. Bumble, and shook him cordially by\\r , the hand.\\r , \\r , \\'I have taken the measure of the two women that died last night, Mr.\\r , Bumble,\\' said the undertaker.\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,\\' said the beadle, as he\\r , thrust his thumb and forefinger into the proffered snuff-box of the\\r , undertaker: which was an ingenious little model of a patent coffin.  \\'I\\r , say you\\'ll make your fortune, Mr. Sowerberry,\\' repeated Mr. Bumble,\\r , tapping the undertaker on the shoulder, in a friendly manner, with his\\r , cane.\\r , \\r , \\'Think so?\\' said the undertaker in a tone which half admitted and half\\r , disputed the probability of the event.  \\'The prices allowed by the\\r , board are very small, Mr. Bumble.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'So are the coffins,\\' replied the beadle: with precisely as near an\\r , approach to a laugh as a great official ought to indulge in.\\r , \\r , Mr. Sowerberry was much tickled at this: as of course he ought to be;\\r , and laughed a long time without cessation.  \\'Well, well, Mr. Bumble,\\'\\r , he said at length, \\'there\\'s no denying that, since the new system of\\r , feeding has come in, the coffins are something narrower and more\\r , shallow than they used to be; but we must have some profit, Mr. Bumble.\\r , Well-seasoned timber is an expensive article, sir; and all the iron\\r , handles come, by canal, from Birmingham.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, well,\\' said Mr. Bumble, \\'every trade has its drawbacks. A fair\\r , profit is, of course, allowable.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Of course, of course,\\' replied the undertaker; \\'and if I don\\'t get a\\r , profit upon this or that particular article, why, I make it up in the\\r , long-run, you see--he! he! he!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Just so,\\' said Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'Though I must say,\\' continued the undertaker, resuming the current of\\r , observations which the beadle had interrupted: \\'though I must say, Mr.\\r , Bumble, that I have to contend against one very great disadvantage:\\r , which is, that all the stout people go off the quickest.  The people\\r , who have been better off, and have paid rates for many years, are the\\r , first to sink when they come into the house; and let me tell you, Mr.\\r , Bumble, that three or four inches over one\\'s calculation makes a great\\r , hole in one\\'s profits: especially when one has a family to provide for,\\r , sir.\\'\\r , \\r , As Mr. Sowerberry said this, with the becoming indignation of an\\r , ill-used man; and as Mr. Bumble felt that it rather tended to convey a\\r , reflection on the honour of the parish; the latter gentleman thought it\\r , advisable to change the subject.  Oliver Twist being uppermost in his\\r , mind, he made him his theme.\\r , \\r , \\'By the bye,\\' said Mr. Bumble, \\'you don\\'t know anybody who wants a boy,\\r , do you?  A porochial \\'prentis, who is at present a dead-weight; a\\r , millstone, as I may say, round the porochial throat?  Liberal terms,\\r , Mr. Sowerberry, liberal terms?\\'  As Mr. Bumble spoke, he raised his\\r , cane to the bill above him, and gave three distinct raps upon the words\\r , \\'five pounds\\':  which were printed thereon in Roman capitals of\\r , gigantic size.\\r , \\r , \\'Gadso!\\' said the undertaker: taking Mr. Bumble by the gilt-edged\\r , lappel of his official coat; \\'that\\'s just the very thing I wanted to\\r , speak to you about.  You know--dear me, what a very elegant button this\\r , is, Mr. Bumble!  I never noticed it before.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, I think it rather pretty,\\' said the beadle, glancing proudly\\r , downwards at the large brass buttons which embellished his coat. \\'The\\r , die is the same as the porochial seal--the Good Samaritan healing the\\r , sick and bruised man. The board presented it to me on Newyear\\'s\\r , morning, Mr. Sowerberry.  I put it on, I remember, for the first time,\\r , to attend the inquest on that reduced tradesman, who died in a doorway\\r , at midnight.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I recollect,\\' said the undertaker. \\'The jury brought it in, \"Died from\\r , exposure to the cold, and want of the common necessaries of life,\"\\r , didn\\'t they?\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble nodded.\\r , \\r , \\'And they made it a special verdict, I think,\\' said the undertaker, \\'by\\r , adding some words to the effect, that if the relieving officer had--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Tush!  Foolery!\\' interposed the beadle.  \\'If the board attended to all\\r , the nonsense that ignorant jurymen talk, they\\'d have enough to do.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Very true,\\' said the undertaker; \\'they would indeed.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Juries,\\' said Mr. Bumble, grasping his cane tightly, as was his wont\\r , when working into a passion: \\'juries is ineddicated, vulgar, grovelling\\r , wretches.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'So they are,\\' said the undertaker.\\r , \\r , \\'They haven\\'t no more philosophy nor political economy about \\'em than\\r , that,\\' said the beadle, snapping his fingers contemptuously.\\r , \\r , \\'No more they have,\\' acquiesced the undertaker.\\r , \\r , \\'I despise \\'em,\\' said the beadle, growing very red in the face.\\r , \\r , \\'So do I,\\' rejoined the undertaker.\\r , \\r , \\'And I only wish we\\'d a jury of the independent sort, in the house for\\r , a week or two,\\' said the beadle; \\'the rules and regulations of the\\r , board would soon bring their spirit down for \\'em.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Let \\'em alone for that,\\' replied the undertaker.  So saying, he\\r , smiled, approvingly: to calm the rising wrath of the indignant parish\\r , officer.\\r , \\r , Mr Bumble lifted off his cocked hat; took a handkerchief from the\\r , inside of the crown; wiped from his forehead the perspiration which his\\r , rage had engendered; fixed the cocked hat on again; and, turning to the\\r , undertaker, said in a calmer voice:\\r , \\r , \\'Well; what about the boy?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh!\\' replied the undertaker; \\'why, you know, Mr. Bumble, I pay a good\\r , deal towards the poor\\'s rates.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hem!\\' said Mr. Bumble.  \\'Well?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well,\\' replied the undertaker, \\'I was thinking that if I pay so much\\r , towards \\'em, I\\'ve a right to get as much out of \\'em as I can, Mr.\\r , Bumble; and so--I think I\\'ll take the boy myself.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble grasped the undertaker by the arm, and led him into the\\r , building.  Mr. Sowerberry was closeted with the board for five minutes;\\r , and it was arranged that Oliver should go to him that evening \\'upon\\r , liking\\'--a phrase which means, in the case of a parish apprentice, that\\r , if the master find, upon a short trial, that he can get enough work out\\r , of a boy without putting too much food into him, he shall have him for\\r , a term of years, to do what he likes with.\\r , \\r , When little Oliver was taken before \\'the gentlemen\\' that evening; and\\r , informed that he was to go, that night, as general house-lad to a\\r , coffin-maker\\'s; and that if he complained of his situation, or ever\\r , came back to the parish again, he would be sent to sea, there to be\\r , drowned, or knocked on the head, as the case might be, he evinced so\\r , little emotion, that they by common consent pronounced him a hardened\\r , young rascal, and ordered Mr. Bumble to remove him forthwith.\\r , \\r , Now, although it was very natural that the board, of all people in the\\r , world, should feel in a great state of virtuous astonishment and horror\\r , at the smallest tokens of want of feeling on the part of anybody, they\\r , were rather out, in this particular instance.  The simple fact was,\\r , that Oliver, instead of possessing too little feeling, possessed rather\\r , too much; and was in a fair way of being reduced, for life, to a state\\r , of brutal stupidity and sullenness by the ill usage he had received.\\r , He heard the news of his destination, in perfect silence; and, having\\r , had his luggage put into his hand--which was not very difficult to\\r , carry, inasmuch as it was all comprised within the limits of a brown\\r , paper parcel, about half a foot square by three inches deep--he pulled\\r , his cap over his eyes; and once more attaching himself to Mr. Bumble\\'s\\r , coat cuff, was led away by that dignitary to a new scene of suffering.\\r , \\r , For some time, Mr. Bumble drew Oliver along, without notice or remark;\\r , for the beadle carried his head very erect, as a beadle always should:\\r , and, it being a windy day, little Oliver was completely enshrouded by\\r , the skirts of Mr. Bumble\\'s coat as they blew open, and disclosed to\\r , great advantage his flapped waistcoat and drab plush knee-breeches.  As\\r , they drew near to their destination, however, Mr. Bumble thought it\\r , expedient to look down, and see that the boy was in good order for\\r , inspection by his new master: which he accordingly did, with a fit and\\r , becoming air of gracious patronage.\\r , \\r , \\'Oliver!\\'  said Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, sir,\\' replied Oliver, in a low, tremulous voice.\\r , \\r , \\'Pull that cap off your eyes, and hold up your head, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , Although Oliver did as he was desired, at once; and passed the back of\\r , his unoccupied hand briskly across his eyes, he left a tear in them\\r , when he looked up at his conductor.  As Mr. Bumble gazed sternly upon\\r , him, it rolled down his cheek. It was followed by another, and another.\\r , The child made a strong effort, but it was an unsuccessful one.\\r , Withdrawing his other hand from Mr. Bumble\\'s he covered his face with\\r , both; and wept until the tears sprung out from between his chin and\\r , bony fingers.\\r , \\r , \\'Well!\\' exclaimed Mr. Bumble, stopping short, and darting at his little\\r , charge a look of intense malignity.  \\'Well!  Of _all_ the\\r , ungratefullest, and worst-disposed boys as ever I see, Oliver, you are\\r , the--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, no, sir,\\' sobbed Oliver, clinging to the hand which held the\\r , well-known cane; \\'no, no, sir; I will be good indeed; indeed, indeed I\\r , will, sir!  I am a very little boy, sir; and it is so--so--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'So what?\\' inquired Mr. Bumble in amazement.\\r , \\r , \\'So lonely, sir!  So very lonely!\\' cried the child.  \\'Everybody hates\\r , me.  Oh! sir, don\\'t, don\\'t pray be cross to me!\\'  The child beat his\\r , hand upon his heart; and looked in his companion\\'s face, with tears of\\r , real agony.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble regarded Oliver\\'s piteous and helpless look, with some\\r , astonishment, for a few seconds; hemmed three or four times in a husky\\r , manner; and after muttering something about \\'that troublesome cough,\\'\\r , bade Oliver dry his eyes and be a good boy. Then once more taking his\\r , hand, he walked on with him in silence.\\r , \\r , The undertaker, who had just put up the shutters of his shop, was\\r , making some entries in his day-book by the light of a most appropriate\\r , dismal candle, when Mr. Bumble entered.\\r , \\r , \\'Aha!\\' said the undertaker; looking up from the book, and pausing in\\r , the middle of a word; \\'is that you, Bumble?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No one else, Mr. Sowerberry,\\' replied the beadle.  \\'Here! I\\'ve brought\\r , the boy.\\'  Oliver made a bow.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh! that\\'s the boy, is it?\\' said the undertaker:  raising the candle\\r , above his head, to get a better view of Oliver. \\'Mrs. Sowerberry, will\\r , you have the goodness to come here a moment, my dear?\\'\\r , \\r , Mrs. Sowerberry emerged from a little room behind the shop, and\\r , presented the form of a short, then, squeezed-up woman, with a vixenish\\r , countenance.\\r , \\r , \\'My dear,\\' said Mr. Sowerberry, deferentially, \\'this is the boy from\\r , the workhouse that I told you of.\\'  Oliver bowed again.\\r , \\r , \\'Dear me!\\' said the undertaker\\'s wife, \\'he\\'s very small.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why, he _is_ rather small,\\' replied Mr. Bumble: looking at Oliver as\\r , if it were his fault that he was no bigger; \\'he is small. There\\'s no\\r , denying it.  But he\\'ll grow, Mrs. Sowerberry--he\\'ll grow.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!  I dare say he will,\\' replied the lady pettishly, \\'on our victuals\\r , and our drink.  I see no saving in parish children, not I; for they\\r , always cost more to keep, than they\\'re worth. However, men always think\\r , they know best. There!  Get downstairs, little bag o\\' bones.\\'  With\\r , this, the undertaker\\'s wife opened a side door, and pushed Oliver down\\r , a steep flight of stairs into a stone cell, damp and dark: forming the\\r , ante-room to the coal-cellar, and denominated \\'kitchen\\'; wherein sat a\\r , slatternly girl, in shoes down at heel, and blue worsted stockings very\\r , much out of repair.\\r , \\r , \\'Here, Charlotte,\\' said Mr. Sowerberry, who had followed Oliver down,\\r , \\'give this boy some of the cold bits that were put by for Trip.  He\\r , hasn\\'t come home since the morning, so he may go without \\'em.  I dare\\r , say the boy isn\\'t too dainty to eat \\'em--are you, boy?\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver, whose eyes had glistened at the mention of meat, and who was\\r , trembling with eagerness to devour it, replied in the negative; and a\\r , plateful of coarse broken victuals was set before him.\\r , \\r , I wish some well-fed philosopher, whose meat and drink turn to gall\\r , within him; whose blood is ice, whose heart is iron; could have seen\\r , Oliver Twist clutching at the dainty viands that the dog had neglected.\\r , I wish he could have witnessed the horrible avidity with which Oliver\\r , tore the bits asunder with all the ferocity of famine.  There is only\\r , one thing I should like better; and that would be to see the\\r , Philosopher making the same sort of meal himself, with the same relish.\\r , \\r , \\'Well,\\' said the undertaker\\'s wife, when Oliver had finished his\\r , supper: which she had regarded in silent horror, and with fearful\\r , auguries of his future appetite: \\'have you done?\\'\\r , \\r , There being nothing eatable within his reach, Oliver replied in the\\r , affirmative.\\r , \\r , \\'Then come with me,\\' said Mrs. Sowerberry: taking up a dim and dirty\\r , lamp, and leading the way upstairs; \\'your bed\\'s under the counter.  You\\r , don\\'t mind sleeping among the coffins, I suppose? But it doesn\\'t much\\r , matter whether you do or don\\'t, for you can\\'t sleep anywhere else.\\r , Come; don\\'t keep me here all night!\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver lingered no longer, but meekly followed his new mistress.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER V\\r , \\r , OLIVER MINGLES WITH NEW ASSOCIATES.  GOING TO A FUNERAL FOR THE FIRST\\r , TIME, HE FORMS AN UNFAVOURABLE NOTION OF HIS MASTER\\'S BUSINESS\\r , \\r , Oliver, being left to himself in the undertaker\\'s shop, set the lamp\\r , down on a workman\\'s bench, and gazed timidly about him with a feeling\\r , of awe and dread, which many people a good deal older than he will be\\r , at no loss to understand.  An unfinished coffin on black tressels,\\r , which stood in the middle of the shop, looked so gloomy and death-like\\r , that a cold tremble came over him, every time his eyes wandered in the\\r , direction of the dismal object: from which he almost expected to see\\r , some frightful form slowly rear its head, to drive him mad with terror.\\r , Against the wall were ranged, in regular array, a long row of elm\\r , boards cut in the same shape: looking in the dim light, like\\r , high-shouldered ghosts with their hands in their breeches pockets.\\r , Coffin-plates, elm-chips, bright-headed nails, and shreds of black\\r , cloth, lay scattered on the floor; and the wall behind the counter was\\r , ornamented with a lively representation of two mutes in very stiff\\r , neckcloths, on duty at a large private door, with a hearse drawn by\\r , four black steeds, approaching in the distance. The shop was close and\\r , hot.  The atmosphere seemed tainted with the smell of coffins.  The\\r , recess beneath the counter in which his flock mattress was thrust,\\r , looked like a grave.\\r , \\r , Nor were these the only dismal feelings which depressed Oliver. He was\\r , alone in a strange place; and we all know how chilled and desolate the\\r , best of us will sometimes feel in such a situation. The boy had no\\r , friends to care for, or to care for him.  The regret of no recent\\r , separation was fresh in his mind; the absence of no loved and\\r , well-remembered face sank heavily into his heart.\\r , \\r , But his heart was heavy, notwithstanding; and he wished, as he crept\\r , into his narrow bed, that that were his coffin, and that he could be\\r , lain in a calm and lasting sleep in the churchyard ground, with the\\r , tall grass waving gently above his head, and the sound of the old deep\\r , bell to soothe him in his sleep.\\r , \\r , Oliver was awakened in the morning, by a loud kicking at the outside of\\r , the shop-door: which, before he could huddle on his clothes, was\\r , repeated, in an angry and impetuous manner, about twenty-five times.\\r , When he began to undo the chain, the legs desisted, and a voice began.\\r , \\r , \\'Open the door, will yer?\\' cried the voice which belonged to the legs\\r , which had kicked at the door.\\r , \\r , \\'I will, directly, sir,\\' replied Oliver: undoing the chain, and turning\\r , the key.\\r , \\r , \\'I suppose yer the new boy, ain\\'t yer?\\' said the voice through the\\r , key-hole.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, sir,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'How old are yer?\\' inquired the voice.\\r , \\r , \\'Ten, sir,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Then I\\'ll whop yer when I get in,\\' said the voice; \\'you just see if I\\r , don\\'t, that\\'s all, my work\\'us brat!\\' and having made this obliging\\r , promise, the voice began to whistle.\\r , \\r , Oliver had been too often subjected to the process to which the very\\r , expressive monosyllable just recorded bears reference, to entertain the\\r , smallest doubt that the owner of the voice, whoever he might be, would\\r , redeem his pledge, most honourably. He drew back the bolts with a\\r , trembling hand, and opened the door.\\r , \\r , For a second or two, Oliver glanced up the street, and down the street,\\r , and over the way: impressed with the belief that the unknown, who had\\r , addressed him through the key-hole, had walked a few paces off, to warm\\r , himself; for nobody did he see but a big charity-boy, sitting on a post\\r , in front of the house, eating a slice of bread and butter: which he cut\\r , into wedges, the size of his mouth, with a clasp-knife, and then\\r , consumed with great dexterity.\\r , \\r , \\'I beg your pardon, sir,\\' said Oliver at length: seeing that no other\\r , visitor made his appearance; \\'did you knock?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I kicked,\\' replied the charity-boy.\\r , \\r , \\'Did you want a coffin, sir?\\' inquired Oliver, innocently.\\r , \\r , At this, the charity-boy looked monstrous fierce; and said that Oliver\\r , would want one before long, if he cut jokes with his superiors in that\\r , way.\\r , \\r , \\'Yer don\\'t know who I am, I suppose, Work\\'us?\\' said the charity-boy, in\\r , continuation: descending from the top of the post, meanwhile, with\\r , edifying gravity.\\r , \\r , \\'No, sir,\\' rejoined Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'m Mister Noah Claypole,\\' said the charity-boy, \\'and you\\'re under me.\\r , Take down the shutters, yer idle young ruffian!\\' With this, Mr.\\r , Claypole administered a kick to Oliver, and entered the shop with a\\r , dignified air, which did him great credit.  It is difficult for a\\r , large-headed, small-eyed youth, of lumbering make and heavy\\r , countenance, to look dignified under any circumstances; but it is more\\r , especially so, when superadded to these personal attractions are a red\\r , nose and yellow smalls.\\r , \\r , Oliver, having taken down the shutters, and broken a pane of glass in\\r , his effort to stagger away beneath the weight of the first one to a\\r , small court at the side of the house in which they were kept during the\\r , day, was graciously assisted by Noah: who having consoled him with the\\r , assurance that \\'he\\'d catch it,\\' condescended to help him.  Mr.\\r , Sowerberry came down soon after. Shortly afterwards, Mrs. Sowerberry\\r , appeared.  Oliver having \\'caught it,\\' in fulfilment of Noah\\'s\\r , prediction, followed that young gentleman down the stairs to breakfast.\\r , \\r , \\'Come near the fire, Noah,\\' said Charlotte.  \\'I saved a nice little bit\\r , of bacon for you from master\\'s breakfast.  Oliver, shut that door at\\r , Mister Noah\\'s back, and take them bits that I\\'ve put out on the cover\\r , of the bread-pan.  There\\'s your tea; take it away to that box, and\\r , drink it there, and make haste, for they\\'ll want you to mind the shop.\\r , D\\'ye hear?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'D\\'ye hear, Work\\'us?\\' said Noah Claypole.\\r , \\r , \\'Lor, Noah!\\' said Charlotte, \\'what a rum creature you are!  Why don\\'t\\r , you let the boy alone?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Let him alone!\\' said Noah.  \\'Why everybody lets him alone enough, for\\r , the matter of that.  Neither his father nor his mother will ever\\r , interfere with him.  All his relations let him have his own way pretty\\r , well.  Eh, Charlotte?  He! he! he!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, you queer soul!\\' said Charlotte, bursting into a hearty laugh, in\\r , which she was joined by Noah; after which they both looked scornfully\\r , at poor Oliver Twist, as he sat shivering on the box in the coldest\\r , corner of the room, and ate the stale pieces which had been specially\\r , reserved for him.\\r , \\r , Noah was a charity-boy, but not a workhouse orphan.  No chance-child\\r , was he, for he could trace his genealogy all the way back to his\\r , parents, who lived hard by; his mother being a washerwoman, and his\\r , father a drunken soldier, discharged with a wooden leg, and a diurnal\\r , pension of twopence-halfpenny and an unstateable fraction.  The\\r , shop-boys in the neighbourhood had long been in the habit of branding\\r , Noah in the public streets, with the ignominious epithets of\\r , \\'leathers,\\' \\'charity,\\' and the like; and Noah had bourne them without\\r , reply.  But, now that fortune had cast in his way a nameless orphan, at\\r , whom even the meanest could point the finger of scorn, he retorted on\\r , him with interest.  This affords charming food for contemplation.  It\\r , shows us what a beautiful thing human nature may be made to be; and how\\r , impartially the same amiable qualities are developed in the finest lord\\r , and the dirtiest charity-boy.\\r , \\r , Oliver had been sojourning at the undertaker\\'s some three weeks or a\\r , month.  Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry--the shop being shut up--were taking\\r , their supper in the little back-parlour, when Mr. Sowerberry, after\\r , several deferential glances at his wife, said,\\r , \\r , \\'My dear--\\'  He was going to say more; but, Mrs. Sowerberry looking up,\\r , with a peculiarly unpropitious aspect, he stopped short.\\r , \\r , \\'Well,\\' said Mrs. Sowerberry, sharply.\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing, my dear, nothing,\\' said Mr. Sowerberry.\\r , \\r , \\'Ugh, you brute!\\' said Mrs. Sowerberry.\\r , \\r , \\'Not at all, my dear,\\' said Mr. Sowerberry humbly.  \\'I thought you\\r , didn\\'t want to hear, my dear.  I was only going to say--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, don\\'t tell me what you were going to say,\\' interposed Mrs.\\r , Sowerberry.  \\'I am nobody; don\\'t consult me, pray.  _I_ don\\'t want to\\r , intrude upon your secrets.\\'  As Mrs. Sowerberry said this, she gave an\\r , hysterical laugh, which threatened violent consequences.\\r , \\r , \\'But, my dear,\\' said Sowerberry, \\'I want to ask your advice.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, no, don\\'t ask mine,\\' replied Mrs. Sowerberry, in an affecting\\r , manner: \\'ask somebody else\\'s.\\'  Here, there was another hysterical\\r , laugh, which frightened Mr. Sowerberry very much.  This is a very\\r , common and much-approved matrimonial course of treatment, which is\\r , often very effective. It at once reduced Mr. Sowerberry to begging, as\\r , a special favour, to be allowed to say what Mrs. Sowerberry was most\\r , curious to hear.  After a short duration, the permission was most\\r , graciously conceded.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s only about young Twist, my dear,\\' said Mr. Sowerberry. \\'A very\\r , good-looking boy, that, my dear.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He need be, for he eats enough,\\' observed the lady.\\r , \\r , \\'There\\'s an expression of melancholy in his face, my dear,\\' resumed Mr.\\r , Sowerberry, \\'which is very interesting.  He would make a delightful\\r , mute, my love.\\'\\r , \\r , Mrs. Sowerberry looked up with an expression of considerable\\r , wonderment.  Mr. Sowerberry remarked it and, without allowing time for\\r , any observation on the good lady\\'s part, proceeded.\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t mean a regular mute to attend grown-up people, my dear, but\\r , only for children\\'s practice.  It would be very new to have a mute in\\r , proportion, my dear.  You may depend upon it, it would have a superb\\r , effect.\\'\\r , \\r , Mrs. Sowerberry, who had a good deal of taste in the undertaking way,\\r , was much struck by the novelty of this idea; but, as it would have been\\r , compromising her dignity to have said so, under existing circumstances,\\r , she merely inquired, with much sharpness, why such an obvious\\r , suggestion had not presented itself to her husband\\'s mind before?  Mr.\\r , Sowerberry rightly construed this, as an acquiescence in his\\r , proposition; it was speedily determined, therefore, that Oliver should\\r , be at once initiated into the mysteries of the trade; and, with this\\r , view, that he should accompany his master on the very next occasion of\\r , his services being required.\\r , \\r , The occasion was not long in coming.  Half an hour after breakfast next\\r , morning, Mr. Bumble entered the shop; and supporting his cane against\\r , the counter, drew forth his large leathern pocket-book: from which he\\r , selected a small scrap of paper, which he handed over to Sowerberry.\\r , \\r , \\'Aha!\\' said the undertaker, glancing over it with a lively countenance;\\r , \\'an order for a coffin, eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'For a coffin first, and a porochial funeral afterwards,\\' replied Mr.\\r , Bumble, fastening the strap of the leathern pocket-book: which, like\\r , himself, was very corpulent.\\r , \\r , \\'Bayton,\\' said the undertaker, looking from the scrap of paper to Mr.\\r , Bumble.  \\'I never heard the name before.\\'\\r , \\r , Bumble shook his head, as he replied, \\'Obstinate people, Mr.\\r , Sowerberry; very obstinate.  Proud, too, I\\'m afraid, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Proud, eh?\\' exclaimed Mr. Sowerberry with a sneer.  \\'Come, that\\'s too\\r , much.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, it\\'s sickening,\\' replied the beadle.  \\'Antimonial, Mr. Sowerberry!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'So it is,\\' acquiesced the undertaker.\\r , \\r , \\'We only heard of the family the night before last,\\' said the beadle;\\r , \\'and we shouldn\\'t have known anything about them, then, only a woman\\r , who lodges in the same house made an application to the porochial\\r , committee for them to send the porochial surgeon to see a woman as was\\r , very bad.  He had gone out to dinner; but his \\'prentice (which is a\\r , very clever lad) sent \\'em some medicine in a blacking-bottle, offhand.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah, there\\'s promptness,\\' said the undertaker.\\r , \\r , \\'Promptness, indeed!\\' replied the beadle.  \\'But what\\'s the consequence;\\r , what\\'s the ungrateful behaviour of these rebels, sir?  Why, the husband\\r , sends back word that the medicine won\\'t suit his wife\\'s complaint, and\\r , so she shan\\'t take it--says she shan\\'t take it, sir!  Good, strong,\\r , wholesome medicine, as was given with great success to two Irish\\r , labourers and a coal-heaver, only a week before--sent \\'em for nothing,\\r , with a blackin\\'-bottle in,--and he sends back word that she shan\\'t take\\r , it, sir!\\'\\r , \\r , As the atrocity presented itself to Mr. Bumble\\'s mind in full force, he\\r , struck the counter sharply with his cane, and became flushed with\\r , indignation.\\r , \\r , \\'Well,\\' said the undertaker, \\'I ne--ver--did--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Never did, sir!\\' ejaculated the beadle.  \\'No, nor nobody never did;\\r , but now she\\'s dead, we\\'ve got to bury her; and that\\'s the direction;\\r , and the sooner it\\'s done, the better.\\'\\r , \\r , Thus saying, Mr. Bumble put on his cocked hat wrong side first, in a\\r , fever of parochial excitement; and flounced out of the shop.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, he was so angry, Oliver, that he forgot even to ask after you!\\'\\r , said Mr. Sowerberry, looking after the beadle as he strode down the\\r , street.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, sir,\\' replied Oliver, who had carefully kept himself out of\\r , sight, during the interview; and who was shaking from head to foot at\\r , the mere recollection of the sound of Mr. Bumble\\'s voice.\\r , \\r , He needn\\'t haven taken the trouble to shrink from Mr. Bumble\\'s glance,\\r , however; for that functionary, on whom the prediction of the gentleman\\r , in the white waistcoat had made a very strong impression, thought that\\r , now the undertaker had got Oliver upon trial the subject was better\\r , avoided, until such time as he should be firmly bound for seven years,\\r , and all danger of his being returned upon the hands of the parish\\r , should be thus effectually and legally overcome.\\r , \\r , \\'Well,\\' said Mr. Sowerberry, taking up his hat, \\'the sooner this job is\\r , done, the better.  Noah, look after the shop. Oliver, put on your cap,\\r , and come with me.\\'  Oliver obeyed, and followed his master on his\\r , professional mission.\\r , \\r , They walked on, for some time, through the most crowded and densely\\r , inhabited part of the town; and then, striking down a narrow street\\r , more dirty and miserable than any they had yet passed through, paused\\r , to look for the house which was the object of their search.  The houses\\r , on either side were high and large, but very old, and tenanted by\\r , people of the poorest class: as their neglected appearance would have\\r , sufficiently denoted, without the concurrent testimony afforded by the\\r , squalid looks of the few men and women who, with folded arms and bodies\\r , half doubled, occasionally skulked along.  A great many of the\\r , tenements had shop-fronts; but these were fast closed, and mouldering\\r , away; only the upper rooms being inhabited.  Some houses which had\\r , become insecure from age and decay, were prevented from falling into\\r , the street, by huge beams of wood reared against the walls, and firmly\\r , planted in the road; but even these crazy dens seemed to have been\\r , selected as the nightly haunts of some houseless wretches, for many of\\r , the rough boards which supplied the place of door and window, were\\r , wrenched from their positions, to afford an aperture wide enough for\\r , the passage of a human body.  The kennel was stagnant and filthy. The\\r , very rats, which here and there lay putrefying in its rottenness, were\\r , hideous with famine.\\r , \\r , There was neither knocker nor bell-handle at the open door where Oliver\\r , and his master stopped; so, groping his way cautiously through the dark\\r , passage, and bidding Oliver keep close to him and not be afraid the\\r , undertaker mounted to the top of the first flight of stairs.  Stumbling\\r , against a door on the landing, he rapped at it with his knuckles.\\r , \\r , It was opened by a young girl of thirteen or fourteen.  The undertaker\\r , at once saw enough of what the room contained, to know it was the\\r , apartment to which he had been directed.  He stepped in; Oliver\\r , followed him.\\r , \\r , There was no fire in the room; but a man was crouching, mechanically,\\r , over the empty stove.  An old woman, too, had drawn a low stool to the\\r , cold hearth, and was sitting beside him. There were some ragged\\r , children in another corner; and in a small recess, opposite the door,\\r , there lay upon the ground, something covered with an old blanket.\\r , Oliver shuddered as he cast his eyes toward the place, and crept\\r , involuntarily closer to his master; for though it was covered up, the\\r , boy felt that it was a corpse.\\r , \\r , The man\\'s face was thin and very pale; his hair and beard were grizzly;\\r , his eyes were bloodshot.  The old woman\\'s face was wrinkled; her two\\r , remaining teeth protruded over her under lip; and her eyes were bright\\r , and piercing.  Oliver was afraid to look at either her or the man.\\r , They seemed so like the rats he had seen outside.\\r , \\r , \\'Nobody shall go near her,\\' said the man, starting fiercely up, as the\\r , undertaker approached the recess. \\'Keep back! Damn you, keep back, if\\r , you\\'ve a life to lose!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nonsense, my good man,\\' said the undertaker, who was pretty well used\\r , to misery in all its shapes.  \\'Nonsense!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I tell you,\\' said the man:  clenching his hands, and stamping\\r , furiously on the floor,--\\'I tell you I won\\'t have her put into the\\r , ground.  She couldn\\'t rest there.  The worms would worry her--not eat\\r , her--she is so worn away.\\'\\r , \\r , The undertaker offered no reply to this raving; but producing a tape\\r , from his pocket, knelt down for a moment by the side of the body.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!\\' said the man: bursting into tears, and sinking on his knees at\\r , the feet of the dead woman; \\'kneel down, kneel down--kneel round her,\\r , every one of you, and mark my words!  I say she was starved to death.\\r , I never knew how bad she was, till the fever came upon her; and then\\r , her bones were starting through the skin.  There was neither fire nor\\r , candle; she died in the dark--in the dark!  She couldn\\'t even see her\\r , children\\'s faces, though we heard her gasping out their names. I begged\\r , for her in the streets: and they sent me to prison. When I came back,\\r , she was dying; and all the blood in my heart has dried up, for they\\r , starved her to death.  I swear it before the God that saw it! They\\r , starved her!\\'  He twined his hands in his hair; and, with a loud\\r , scream, rolled grovelling upon the floor: his eyes fixed, and the foam\\r , covering his lips.\\r , \\r , The terrified children cried bitterly; but the old woman, who had\\r , hitherto remained as quiet as if she had been wholly deaf to all that\\r , passed, menaced them into silence.  Having unloosened the cravat of the\\r , man who still remained extended on the ground, she tottered towards the\\r , undertaker.\\r , \\r , \\'She was my daughter,\\' said the old woman, nodding her head in the\\r , direction of the corpse; and speaking with an idiotic leer, more\\r , ghastly than even the presence of death in such a place. \\'Lord, Lord!\\r , Well, it _is_ strange that I who gave birth to her, and was a woman\\r , then, should be alive and merry now, and she lying there: so cold and\\r , stiff!  Lord, Lord!--to think of it; it\\'s as good as a play--as good as\\r , a play!\\'\\r , \\r , As the wretched creature mumbled and chuckled in her hideous merriment,\\r , the undertaker turned to go away.\\r , \\r , \\'Stop, stop!\\' said the old woman in a loud whisper.  \\'Will she be\\r , buried to-morrow, or next day, or to-night?  I laid her out; and I must\\r , walk, you know.  Send me a large cloak: a good warm one: for it is\\r , bitter cold.  We should have cake and wine, too, before we go!  Never\\r , mind; send some bread--only a loaf of bread and a cup of water.  Shall\\r , we have some bread, dear?\\' she said eagerly: catching at the\\r , undertaker\\'s coat, as he once more moved towards the door.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, yes,\\' said the undertaker,\\'of course.  Anything you like!\\' He\\r , disengaged himself from the old woman\\'s grasp; and, drawing Oliver\\r , after him, hurried away.\\r , \\r , The next day, (the family having been meanwhile relieved with a\\r , half-quartern loaf and a piece of cheese, left with them by Mr. Bumble\\r , himself,) Oliver and his master returned to the miserable abode; where\\r , Mr. Bumble had already arrived, accompanied by four men from the\\r , workhouse, who were to act as bearers.  An old black cloak had been\\r , thrown over the rags of the old woman and the man; and the bare coffin\\r , having been screwed down, was hoisted on the shoulders of the bearers,\\r , and carried into the street.\\r , \\r , \\'Now, you must put your best leg foremost, old lady!\\' whispered\\r , Sowerberry in the old woman\\'s ear; \\'we are rather late; and it won\\'t\\r , do, to keep the clergyman waiting.  Move on, my men,--as quick as you\\r , like!\\'\\r , \\r , Thus directed, the bearers trotted on under their light burden; and the\\r , two mourners kept as near them, as they could.  Mr. Bumble and\\r , Sowerberry walked at a good smart pace in front; and Oliver, whose legs\\r , were not so long as his master\\'s, ran by the side.\\r , \\r , There was not so great a necessity for hurrying as Mr. Sowerberry had\\r , anticipated, however; for when they reached the obscure corner of the\\r , churchyard in which the nettles grew, and where the parish graves were\\r , made, the clergyman had not arrived; and the clerk, who was sitting by\\r , the vestry-room fire, seemed to think it by no means improbable that it\\r , might be an hour or so, before he came.  So, they put the bier on the\\r , brink of the grave; and the two mourners waited patiently in the damp\\r , clay, with a cold rain drizzling down, while the ragged boys whom the\\r , spectacle had attracted into the churchyard played a noisy game at\\r , hide-and-seek among the tombstones, or varied their amusements by\\r , jumping backwards and forwards over the coffin.  Mr. Sowerberry and\\r , Bumble, being personal friends of the clerk, sat by the fire with him,\\r , and read the paper.\\r , \\r , At length, after a lapse of something more than an hour, Mr. Bumble,\\r , and Sowerberry, and the clerk, were seen running towards the grave.\\r , Immediately afterwards, the clergyman appeared: putting on his surplice\\r , as he came along.  Mr. Bumble then thrashed a boy or two, to keep up\\r , appearances; and the reverend gentleman, having read as much of the\\r , burial service as could be compressed into four minutes, gave his\\r , surplice to the clerk, and walked away again.\\r , \\r , \\'Now, Bill!\\' said Sowerberry to the grave-digger. \\'Fill up!\\'\\r , \\r , It was no very difficult task, for the grave was so full, that the\\r , uppermost coffin was within a few feet of the surface.  The\\r , grave-digger shovelled in the earth; stamped it loosely down with his\\r , feet: shouldered his spade; and walked off, followed by the boys, who\\r , murmured very loud complaints at the fun being over so soon.\\r , \\r , \\'Come, my good fellow!\\' said Bumble, tapping the man on the back. \\'They\\r , want to shut up the yard.\\'\\r , \\r , The man who had never once moved, since he had taken his station by the\\r , grave side, started, raised his head, stared at the person who had\\r , addressed him, walked forward for a few paces; and fell down in a\\r , swoon.  The crazy old woman was too much occupied in bewailing the loss\\r , of her cloak (which the undertaker had taken off), to pay him any\\r , attention; so they threw a can of cold water over him; and when he came\\r , to, saw him safely out of the churchyard, locked the gate, and departed\\r , on their different ways.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, Oliver,\\' said Sowerberry, as they walked home, \\'how do you like\\r , it?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Pretty well, thank you, sir\\' replied Oliver, with considerable\\r , hesitation.  \\'Not very much, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah, you\\'ll get used to it in time, Oliver,\\' said Sowerberry. \\'Nothing\\r , when you _are_ used to it, my boy.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver wondered, in his own mind, whether it had taken a very long time\\r , to get Mr. Sowerberry used to it.  But he thought it better not to ask\\r , the question; and walked back to the shop: thinking over all he had\\r , seen and heard.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER VI\\r , \\r , OLIVER, BEING GOADED BY THE TAUNTS OF NOAH, ROUSES INTO ACTION, AND\\r , RATHER ASTONISHES HIM\\r , \\r , The month\\'s trial over, Oliver was formally apprenticed.  It was a nice\\r , sickly season just at this time.  In commercial phrase, coffins were\\r , looking up; and, in the course of a few weeks, Oliver acquired a great\\r , deal of experience.  The success of Mr. Sowerberry\\'s ingenious\\r , speculation, exceeded even his most sanguine hopes.  The oldest\\r , inhabitants recollected no period at which measles had been so\\r , prevalent, or so fatal to infant existence; and many were the mournful\\r , processions which little Oliver headed, in a hat-band reaching down to\\r , his knees, to the indescribable admiration and emotion of all the\\r , mothers in the town.  As Oliver accompanied his master in most of his\\r , adult expeditions too, in order that he might acquire that equanimity\\r , of demeanour and full command of nerve which was essential to a\\r , finished undertaker, he had many opportunities of observing the\\r , beautiful resignation and fortitude with which some strong-minded\\r , people bear their trials and losses.\\r , \\r , For instance; when Sowerberry had an order for the burial of some rich\\r , old lady or gentleman, who was surrounded by a great number of nephews\\r , and nieces, who had been perfectly inconsolable during the previous\\r , illness, and whose grief had been wholly irrepressible even on the most\\r , public occasions, they would be as happy among themselves as need\\r , be--quite cheerful and contented--conversing together with as much\\r , freedom and gaiety, as if nothing whatever had happened to disturb\\r , them.  Husbands, too, bore the loss of their wives with the most heroic\\r , calmness. Wives, again, put on weeds for their husbands, as if, so far\\r , from grieving in the garb of sorrow, they had made up their minds to\\r , render it as becoming and attractive as possible.  It was observable,\\r , too, that ladies and gentlemen who were in passions of anguish during\\r , the ceremony of interment, recovered almost as soon as they reached\\r , home, and became quite composed before the tea-drinking was over.  All\\r , this was very pleasant and improving to see; and Oliver beheld it with\\r , great admiration.\\r , \\r , That Oliver Twist was moved to resignation by the example of these good\\r , people, I cannot, although I am his biographer, undertake to affirm\\r , with any degree of confidence; but I can most distinctly say, that for\\r , many months he continued meekly to submit to the domination and\\r , ill-treatment of Noah Claypole: who used him far worse than before, now\\r , that his jealousy was roused by seeing the new boy promoted to the\\r , black stick and hatband, while he, the old one, remained stationary in\\r , the muffin-cap and leathers.  Charlotte treated him ill, because Noah\\r , did; and Mrs. Sowerberry was his decided enemy, because Mr. Sowerberry\\r , was disposed to be his friend; so, between these three on one side, and\\r , a glut of funerals on the other, Oliver was not altogether as\\r , comfortable as the hungry pig was, when he was shut up, by mistake, in\\r , the grain department of a brewery.\\r , \\r , And now, I come to a very important passage in Oliver\\'s history; for I\\r , have to record an act, slight and unimportant perhaps in appearance,\\r , but which indirectly produced a material change in all his future\\r , prospects and proceedings.\\r , \\r , One day, Oliver and Noah had descended into the kitchen at the usual\\r , dinner-hour, to banquet upon a small joint of mutton--a pound and a\\r , half of the worst end of the neck--when Charlotte being called out of\\r , the way, there ensued a brief interval of time, which Noah Claypole,\\r , being hungry and vicious, considered he could not possibly devote to a\\r , worthier purpose than aggravating and tantalising young Oliver Twist.\\r , \\r , Intent upon this innocent amusement, Noah put his feet on the\\r , table-cloth; and pulled Oliver\\'s hair; and twitched his ears; and\\r , expressed his opinion that he was a \\'sneak\\'; and furthermore announced\\r , his intention of coming to see him hanged, whenever that desirable\\r , event should take place; and entered upon various topics of petty\\r , annoyance, like a malicious and ill-conditioned charity-boy as he was.\\r , But, making Oliver cry, Noah attempted to be more facetious still; and\\r , in his attempt, did what many sometimes do to this day, when they want\\r , to be funny.  He got rather personal.\\r , \\r , \\'Work\\'us,\\' said Noah, \\'how\\'s your mother?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'She\\'s dead,\\' replied Oliver; \\'don\\'t you say anything about her to me!\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver\\'s colour rose as he said this; he breathed quickly; and there\\r , was a curious working of the mouth and nostrils, which Mr. Claypole\\r , thought must be the immediate precursor of a violent fit of crying.\\r , Under this impression he returned to the charge.\\r , \\r , \\'What did she die of, Work\\'us?\\' said Noah.\\r , \\r , \\'Of a broken heart, some of our old nurses told me,\\' replied Oliver:\\r , more as if he were talking to himself, than answering Noah. \\'I think I\\r , know what it must be to die of that!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Tol de rol lol lol, right fol lairy, Work\\'us,\\' said Noah, as a tear\\r , rolled down Oliver\\'s cheek.  \\'What\\'s set you a snivelling now?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not _you_,\\' replied Oliver, sharply. \\'There; that\\'s enough. Don\\'t say\\r , anything more to me about her; you\\'d better not!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Better not!\\' exclaimed Noah. \\'Well!  Better not!  Work\\'us, don\\'t be\\r , impudent.  _Your_ mother, too!  She was a nice \\'un she was.  Oh, Lor!\\'\\r , And here, Noah nodded his head expressively; and curled up as much of\\r , his small red nose as muscular action could collect together, for the\\r , occasion.\\r , \\r , \\'Yer know, Work\\'us,\\' continued Noah, emboldened by Oliver\\'s silence,\\r , and speaking in a jeering tone of affected pity: of all tones the most\\r , annoying: \\'Yer know, Work\\'us, it can\\'t be helped now; and of course yer\\r , couldn\\'t help it then; and I am very sorry for it; and I\\'m sure we all\\r , are, and pity yer very much.  But yer must know, Work\\'us, yer mother\\r , was a regular right-down bad \\'un.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What did you say?\\' inquired Oliver, looking up very quickly.\\r , \\r , \\'A regular right-down bad \\'un, Work\\'us,\\' replied Noah, coolly. \\'And\\r , it\\'s a great deal better, Work\\'us, that she died when she did, or else\\r , she\\'d have been hard labouring in Bridewell, or transported, or hung;\\r , which is more likely than either, isn\\'t it?\\'\\r , \\r , Crimson with fury, Oliver started up; overthrew the chair and table;\\r , seized Noah by the throat; shook him, in the violence of his rage, till\\r , his teeth chattered in his head; and collecting his whole force into\\r , one heavy blow, felled him to the ground.\\r , \\r , A minute ago, the boy had looked the quiet child, mild, dejected\\r , creature that harsh treatment had made him.  But his spirit was roused\\r , at last; the cruel insult to his dead mother had set his blood on fire.\\r , His breast heaved; his attitude was erect; his eye bright and vivid;\\r , his whole person changed, as he stood glaring over the cowardly\\r , tormentor who now lay crouching at his feet; and defied him with an\\r , energy he had never known before.\\r , \\r , \\'He\\'ll murder me!\\' blubbered Noah.  \\'Charlotte!  missis!  Here\\'s the\\r , new boy a murdering of me!  Help! help!  Oliver\\'s gone mad!\\r , Char--lotte!\\'\\r , \\r , Noah\\'s shouts were responded to, by a loud scream from Charlotte, and a\\r , louder from Mrs. Sowerberry; the former of whom rushed into the kitchen\\r , by a side-door, while the latter paused on the staircase till she was\\r , quite certain that it was consistent with the preservation of human\\r , life, to come further down.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, you little wretch!\\' screamed Charlotte: seizing Oliver with her\\r , utmost force, which was about equal to that of a moderately strong man\\r , in particularly good training.  \\'Oh, you little un-grate-ful,\\r , mur-de-rous, hor-rid villain!\\'  And between every syllable, Charlotte\\r , gave Oliver a blow with all her might: accompanying it with a scream,\\r , for the benefit of society.\\r , \\r , Charlotte\\'s fist was by no means a light one; but, lest it should not\\r , be effectual in calming Oliver\\'s wrath, Mrs. Sowerberry plunged into\\r , the kitchen, and assisted to hold him with one hand, while she\\r , scratched his face with the other. In this favourable position of\\r , affairs, Noah rose from the ground, and pommelled him behind.\\r , \\r , This was rather too violent exercise to last long.  When they were all\\r , wearied out, and could tear and beat no longer, they dragged Oliver,\\r , struggling and shouting, but nothing daunted, into the dust-cellar, and\\r , there locked him up.  This being done, Mrs. Sowerberry sunk into a\\r , chair, and burst into tears.\\r , \\r , \\'Bless her, she\\'s going off!\\' said Charlotte.  \\'A glass of water, Noah,\\r , dear.  Make haste!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh!  Charlotte,\\' said Mrs. Sowerberry:  speaking as well as she could,\\r , through a deficiency of breath, and a sufficiency of cold water, which\\r , Noah had poured over her head and shoulders.  \\'Oh! Charlotte, what a\\r , mercy we have not all been murdered in our beds!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah! mercy indeed, ma\\'am,\\' was the reply.  I only hope this\\'ll teach\\r , master not to have any more of these dreadful creatures, that are born\\r , to be murderers and robbers from their very cradle. Poor Noah!  He was\\r , all but killed, ma\\'am, when I come in.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Poor fellow!\\' said Mrs. Sowerberry: looking piteously on the\\r , charity-boy.\\r , \\r , Noah, whose top waistcoat-button might have been somewhere on a level\\r , with the crown of Oliver\\'s head, rubbed his eyes with the inside of his\\r , wrists while this commiseration was bestowed upon him, and performed\\r , some affecting tears and sniffs.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s to be done!\\' exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.  \\'Your master\\'s not at\\r , home; there\\'s not a man in the house, and he\\'ll kick that door down in\\r , ten minutes.\\'  Oliver\\'s vigorous plunges against the bit of timber in\\r , question, rendered this occurance highly probable.\\r , \\r , \\'Dear, dear!  I don\\'t know, ma\\'am,\\' said Charlotte, \\'unless we send for\\r , the police-officers.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Or the millingtary,\\' suggested Mr. Claypole.\\r , \\r , \\'No, no,\\' said Mrs. Sowerberry: bethinking herself of Oliver\\'s old\\r , friend.  \\'Run to Mr. Bumble, Noah, and tell him to come here directly,\\r , and not to lose a minute; never mind your cap!  Make haste!  You can\\r , hold a knife to that black eye, as you run along. It\\'ll keep the\\r , swelling down.\\'\\r , \\r , Noah stopped to make no reply, but started off at his fullest speed;\\r , and very much it astonished the people who were out walking, to see a\\r , charity-boy tearing through the streets pell-mell, with no cap on his\\r , head, and a clasp-knife at his eye.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER VII\\r , \\r , OLIVER CONTINUES REFRACTORY\\r , \\r , Noah Claypole ran along the streets at his swiftest pace, and paused\\r , not once for breath, until he reached the workhouse-gate. Having rested\\r , here, for a minute or so, to collect a good burst of sobs and an\\r , imposing show of tears and terror, he knocked loudly at the wicket; and\\r , presented such a rueful face to the aged pauper who opened it, that\\r , even he, who saw nothing but rueful faces about him at the best of\\r , times, started back in astonishment.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, what\\'s the matter with the boy!\\' said the old pauper.\\r , \\r , \\'Mr. Bumble!  Mr. Bumble!\\' cried Noah, with well-affected dismay: and\\r , in tones so loud and agitated, that they not only caught the ear of Mr.\\r , Bumble himself, who happened to be hard by, but alarmed him so much\\r , that he rushed into the yard without his cocked hat,--which is a very\\r , curious and remarkable circumstance: as showing that even a beadle,\\r , acted upon a sudden and powerful impulse, may be afflicted with a\\r , momentary visitation of loss of self-possession, and forgetfulness of\\r , personal dignity.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, Mr. Bumble, sir!\\' said Noah:  \\'Oliver, sir,--Oliver has--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What?  What?\\' interposed Mr. Bumble: with a gleam of pleasure in his\\r , metallic eyes. \\'Not run away; he hasn\\'t run away, has he, Noah?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, sir, no.  Not run away, sir, but he\\'s turned wicious,\\' replied\\r , Noah. \\'He tried to murder me, sir; and then he tried to murder\\r , Charlotte; and then missis.  Oh! what dreadful pain it is!\\r , \\r , Such agony, please, sir!\\'  And here, Noah writhed and twisted his body\\r , into an extensive variety of eel-like positions; thereby giving Mr.\\r , Bumble to understand that, from the violent and sanguinary onset of\\r , Oliver Twist, he had sustained severe internal injury and damage, from\\r , which he was at that moment suffering the acutest torture.\\r , \\r , When Noah saw that the intelligence he communicated perfectly paralysed\\r , Mr. Bumble, he imparted additional effect thereunto, by bewailing his\\r , dreadful wounds ten times louder than before; and when he observed a\\r , gentleman in a white waistcoat crossing the yard, he was more tragic in\\r , his lamentations than ever: rightly conceiving it highly expedient to\\r , attract the notice, and rouse the indignation, of the gentleman\\r , aforesaid.\\r , \\r , The gentleman\\'s notice was very soon attracted; for he had not walked\\r , three paces, when he turned angrily round, and inquired what that young\\r , cur was howling for, and why Mr. Bumble did not favour him with\\r , something which would render the series of vocular exclamations so\\r , designated, an involuntary process?\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s a poor boy from the free-school, sir,\\' replied Mr. Bumble, \\'who\\r , has been nearly murdered--all but murdered, sir,--by young Twist.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'By Jove!\\' exclaimed the gentleman in the white waistcoat, stopping\\r , short.  \\'I knew it!  I felt a strange presentiment from the very first,\\r , that that audacious young savage would come to be hung!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He has likewise attempted, sir, to murder the female servant,\\' said\\r , Mr. Bumble, with a face of ashy paleness.\\r , \\r , \\'And his missis,\\' interposed Mr. Claypole.\\r , \\r , \\'And his master, too, I think you said, Noah?\\' added Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'No! he\\'s out, or he would have murdered him,\\' replied Noah. \\'He said\\r , he wanted to.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!  Said he wanted to, did he, my boy?\\' inquired the gentleman in the\\r , white waistcoat.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, sir,\\' replied Noah.  \\'And please, sir, missis wants to know\\r , whether Mr. Bumble can spare time to step up there, directly, and flog\\r , him--\\'cause master\\'s out.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Certainly, my boy; certainly,\\' said the gentleman in the white\\r , waistcoat: smiling benignly, and patting Noah\\'s head, which was about\\r , three inches higher than his own.  \\'You\\'re a good boy--a very good boy.\\r , Here\\'s a penny for you.  Bumble, just step up to Sowerberry\\'s with your\\r , cane, and see what\\'s best to be done. Don\\'t spare him, Bumble.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, I will not, sir,\\' replied the beadle.  And the cocked hat and cane\\r , having been, by this time, adjusted to their owner\\'s satisfaction, Mr.\\r , Bumble and Noah Claypole betook themselves with all speed to the\\r , undertaker\\'s shop.\\r , \\r , Here the position of affairs had not at all improved.  Sowerberry had\\r , not yet returned, and Oliver continued to kick, with undiminished\\r , vigour, at the cellar-door.  The accounts of his ferocity as related by\\r , Mrs. Sowerberry and Charlotte, were of so startling a nature, that Mr.\\r , Bumble judged it prudent to parley, before opening the door.  With this\\r , view he gave a kick at the outside, by way of prelude; and, then,\\r , applying his mouth to the keyhole, said, in a deep and impressive tone:\\r , \\r , \\'Oliver!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Come; you let me out!\\' replied Oliver, from the inside.\\r , \\r , \\'Do you know this here voice, Oliver?\\' said Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Ain\\'t you afraid of it, sir?  Ain\\'t you a-trembling while I speak,\\r , sir?\\' said Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'No!\\' replied Oliver, boldly.\\r , \\r , An answer so different from the one he had expected to elicit, and was\\r , in the habit of receiving, staggered Mr. Bumble not a little.  He\\r , stepped back from the keyhole; drew himself up to his full height; and\\r , looked from one to another of the three bystanders, in mute\\r , astonishment.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, you know, Mr. Bumble, he must be mad,\\' said Mrs. Sowerberry.\\r , \\r , \\'No boy in half his senses could venture to speak so to you.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s not Madness, ma\\'am,\\' replied Mr. Bumble, after a few moments of\\r , deep meditation.  \\'It\\'s Meat.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What?\\' exclaimed Mrs. Sowerberry.\\r , \\r , \\'Meat, ma\\'am, meat,\\' replied Bumble, with stern emphasis. \\'You\\'ve\\r , over-fed him, ma\\'am.  You\\'ve raised a artificial soul and spirit in\\r , him, ma\\'am unbecoming a person of his condition: as the board, Mrs.\\r , Sowerberry, who are practical philosophers, will tell you.  What have\\r , paupers to do with soul or spirit?  It\\'s quite enough that we let \\'em\\r , have live bodies.  If you had kept the boy on gruel, ma\\'am, this would\\r , never have happened.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Dear, dear!\\' ejaculated Mrs. Sowerberry, piously raising her eyes to\\r , the kitchen ceiling: \\'this comes of being liberal!\\'\\r , \\r , The liberality of Mrs. Sowerberry to Oliver, had consisted of a profuse\\r , bestowal upon him of all the dirty odds and ends which nobody else\\r , would eat; so there was a great deal of meekness and self-devotion in\\r , her voluntarily remaining under Mr. Bumble\\'s heavy accusation.  Of\\r , which, to do her justice, she was wholly innocent, in thought, word, or\\r , deed.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!\\' said Mr. Bumble, when the lady brought her eyes down to earth\\r , again; \\'the only thing that can be done now, that I know of, is to\\r , leave him in the cellar for a day or so, till he\\'s a little starved\\r , down; and then to take him out, and keep him on gruel all through the\\r , apprenticeship.  He comes of a bad family. Excitable natures, Mrs.\\r , Sowerberry!  Both the nurse and doctor said, that that mother of his\\r , made her way here, against difficulties and pain that would have killed\\r , any well-disposed woman, weeks before.\\'\\r , \\r , At this point of Mr. Bumble\\'s discourse, Oliver, just hearing enough to\\r , know that some allusion was being made to his mother, recommenced\\r , kicking, with a violence that rendered every other sound inaudible.\\r , Sowerberry returned at this juncture.  Oliver\\'s offence having been\\r , explained to him, with such exaggerations as the ladies thought best\\r , calculated to rouse his ire, he unlocked the cellar-door in a\\r , twinkling, and dragged his rebellious apprentice out, by the collar.\\r , \\r , Oliver\\'s clothes had been torn in the beating he had received; his face\\r , was bruised and scratched; and his hair scattered over his forehead.\\r , The angry flush had not disappeared, however; and when he was pulled\\r , out of his prison, he scowled boldly on Noah, and looked quite\\r , undismayed.\\r , \\r , \\'Now, you are a nice young fellow, ain\\'t you?\\' said Sowerberry; giving\\r , Oliver a shake, and a box on the ear.\\r , \\r , \\'He called my mother names,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, and what if he did, you little ungrateful wretch?\\' said Mrs.\\r , Sowerberry.  \\'She deserved what he said, and worse.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'She didn\\'t\\' said Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'She did,\\' said Mrs. Sowerberry.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s a lie!\\' said Oliver.\\r , \\r , Mrs. Sowerberry burst into a flood of tears.\\r , \\r , This flood of tears left Mr. Sowerberry no alternative.  If he had\\r , hesitated for one instant to punish Oliver most severely, it must be\\r , quite clear to every experienced reader that he would have been,\\r , according to all precedents in disputes of matrimony established, a\\r , brute, an unnatural husband, an insulting creature, a base imitation of\\r , a man, and various other agreeable characters too numerous for recital\\r , within the limits of this chapter.  To do him justice, he was, as far\\r , as his power went--it was not very extensive--kindly disposed towards\\r , the boy; perhaps, because it was his interest to be so; perhaps,\\r , because his wife disliked him. The flood of tears, however, left him no\\r , resource; so he at once gave him a drubbing, which satisfied even Mrs.\\r , Sowerberry herself, and rendered Mr. Bumble\\'s subsequent application of\\r , the parochial cane, rather unnecessary.  For the rest of the day, he\\r , was shut up in the back kitchen, in company with a pump and a slice of\\r , bread; and at night, Mrs. Sowerberry, after making various remarks\\r , outside the door, by no means complimentary to the memory of his\\r , mother, looked into the room, and, amidst the jeers and pointings of\\r , Noah and Charlotte, ordered him upstairs to his dismal bed.\\r , \\r , It was not until he was left alone in the silence and stillness of the\\r , gloomy workshop of the undertaker, that Oliver gave way to the feelings\\r , which the day\\'s treatment may be supposed likely to have awakened in a\\r , mere child.  He had listened to their taunts with a look of contempt;\\r , he had borne the lash without a cry: for he felt that pride swelling in\\r , his heart which would have kept down a shriek to the last, though they\\r , had roasted him alive.  But now, when there were none to see or hear\\r , him, he fell upon his knees on the floor; and, hiding his face in his\\r , hands, wept such tears as, God send for the credit of our nature, few\\r , so young may ever have cause to pour out before him!\\r , \\r , For a long time, Oliver remained motionless in this attitude. The\\r , candle was burning low in the socket when he rose to his feet. Having\\r , gazed cautiously round him, and listened intently, he gently undid the\\r , fastenings of the door, and looked abroad.\\r , \\r , It was a cold, dark night.  The stars seemed, to the boy\\'s eyes,\\r , farther from the earth than he had ever seen them before; there was no\\r , wind; and the sombre shadows thrown by the trees upon the ground,\\r , looked sepulchral and death-like, from being so still. He softly\\r , reclosed the door.  Having availed himself of the expiring light of the\\r , candle to tie up in a handkerchief the few articles of wearing apparel\\r , he had, sat himself down upon a bench, to wait for morning.\\r , \\r , With the first ray of light that struggled through the crevices in the\\r , shutters, Oliver arose, and again unbarred the door.  One timid look\\r , around--one moment\\'s pause of hesitation--he had closed it behind him,\\r , and was in the open street.\\r , \\r , He looked to the right and to the left, uncertain whither to fly.\\r , \\r , He remembered to have seen the waggons, as they went out, toiling up\\r , the hill.  He took the same route; and arriving at a footpath across\\r , the fields: which he knew, after some distance, led out again into the\\r , road; struck into it, and walked quickly on.\\r , \\r , Along this same footpath, Oliver well-remembered he had trotted beside\\r , Mr. Bumble, when he first carried him to the workhouse from the farm.\\r , His way lay directly in front of the cottage. His heart beat quickly\\r , when he bethought himself of this; and he half resolved to turn back.\\r , He had come a long way though, and should lose a great deal of time by\\r , doing so.  Besides, it was so early that there was very little fear of\\r , his being seen; so he walked on.\\r , \\r , He reached the house.  There was no appearance of its inmates stirring\\r , at that early hour.  Oliver stopped, and peeped into the garden.  A\\r , child was weeding one of the little beds; as he stopped, he raised his\\r , pale face and disclosed the features of one of his former companions.\\r , Oliver felt glad to see him, before he went; for, though younger than\\r , himself, he had been his little friend and playmate.  They had been\\r , beaten, and starved, and shut up together, many and many a time.\\r , \\r , \\'Hush, Dick!\\' said Oliver, as the boy ran to the gate, and thrust his\\r , thin arm between the rails to greet him.  \\'Is any one up?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nobody but me,\\' replied the child.\\r , \\r , \\'You musn\\'t say you saw me, Dick,\\' said Oliver.  \\'I am running away.\\r , They beat and ill-use me, Dick; and I am going to seek my fortune, some\\r , long way off.  I don\\'t know where.  How pale you are!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I heard the doctor tell them I was dying,\\' replied the child with a\\r , faint smile.  \\'I am very glad to see you, dear; but don\\'t stop, don\\'t\\r , stop!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, yes, I will, to say good-b\\'ye to you,\\' replied Oliver. \\'I shall\\r , see you again, Dick.  I know I shall!  You will be well and happy!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I hope so,\\' replied the child.  \\'After I am dead, but not before.  I\\r , know the doctor must be right, Oliver, because I dream so much of\\r , Heaven, and Angels, and kind faces that I never see when I am awake.\\r , Kiss me,\\' said the child,  climbing up the low gate, and flinging his\\r , little arms round Oliver\\'s neck. \\'Good-b\\'ye, dear!  God bless you!\\'\\r , \\r , The blessing was from a young child\\'s lips, but it was the first that\\r , Oliver had ever heard invoked upon his head; and through the struggles\\r , and sufferings, and troubles and changes, of his after life, he never\\r , once forgot it.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER VIII\\r , \\r , OLIVER WALKS TO LONDON.  HE ENCOUNTERS ON THE ROAD A STRANGE SORT OF\\r , YOUNG GENTLEMAN\\r , \\r , Oliver reached the stile at which the by-path terminated; and once more\\r , gained the high-road.  It was eight o\\'clock now. Though he was nearly\\r , five miles away from the town, he ran, and hid behind the hedges, by\\r , turns, till noon: fearing that he might be pursued and overtaken.  Then\\r , he sat down to rest by the side of the milestone, and began to think,\\r , for the first time, where he had better go and try to live.\\r , \\r , The stone by which he was seated, bore, in large characters, an\\r , intimation that it was just seventy miles from that spot to London. The\\r , name awakened a new train of ideas in the boy\\'s mind.\\r , \\r , London!--that great place!--nobody--not even Mr. Bumble--could ever\\r , find him there!  He had often heard the old men in the workhouse, too,\\r , say that no lad of spirit need want in London; and that there were ways\\r , of living in that vast city, which those who had been bred up in\\r , country parts had no idea of.  It was the very place for a homeless\\r , boy, who must die in the streets unless some one helped him. As these\\r , things passed through his thoughts, he jumped upon his feet, and again\\r , walked forward.\\r , \\r , He had diminished the distance between himself and London by full four\\r , miles more, before he recollected how much he must undergo ere he could\\r , hope to reach his place of destination. As this consideration forced\\r , itself upon him, he slackened his pace a little, and meditated upon his\\r , means of getting there.  He had a crust of bread, a coarse shirt, and\\r , two pairs of stockings, in his bundle.  He had a penny too--a gift of\\r , Sowerberry\\'s after some funeral in which he had acquitted himself more\\r , than ordinarily well--in his pocket. \\'A clean shirt,\\' thought Oliver,\\r , \\'is a very comfortable thing; and so are two pairs of darned stockings;\\r , and so is a penny; but they are small helps to a sixty-five miles\\' walk\\r , in winter time.\\'  But Oliver\\'s thoughts, like those of most other\\r , people, although they were extremely ready and active to point out his\\r , difficulties, were wholly at a loss to suggest any feasible mode of\\r , surmounting them; so, after a good deal of thinking to no particular\\r , purpose, he changed his little bundle over to the other shoulder, and\\r , trudged on.\\r , \\r , Oliver walked twenty miles that day; and all that time tasted nothing\\r , but the crust of dry bread, and a few draughts of water, which he\\r , begged at the cottage-doors by the road-side.  When the night came, he\\r , turned into a meadow; and, creeping close under a hay-rick, determined\\r , to lie there, till morning.  He felt frightened at first, for the wind\\r , moaned dismally over the empty fields: and he was cold and hungry, and\\r , more alone than he had ever felt before.  Being very tired with his\\r , walk, however, he soon fell asleep and forgot his troubles.\\r , \\r , He felt cold and stiff, when he got up next morning, and so hungry that\\r , he was obliged to exchange the penny for a small loaf, in the very\\r , first village through which he passed.  He had walked no more than\\r , twelve miles, when night closed in again. His feet were sore, and his\\r , legs so weak that they trembled beneath him.  Another night passed in\\r , the bleak damp air, made him worse; when he set forward on his journey\\r , next morning he could hardly crawl along.\\r , \\r , He waited at the bottom of a steep hill till a stage-coach came up, and\\r , then begged of the outside passengers; but there were very few who took\\r , any notice of him: and even those told him to wait till they got to the\\r , top of the hill, and then let them see how far he could run for a\\r , halfpenny.  Poor Oliver tried to keep up with the coach a little way,\\r , but was unable to do it, by reason of his fatigue and sore feet.  When\\r , the outsides saw this, they put their halfpence back into their pockets\\r , again, declaring that he was an idle young dog, and didn\\'t deserve\\r , anything; and the coach rattled away and left only a cloud of dust\\r , behind.\\r , \\r , In some villages, large painted boards were fixed up: warning all\\r , persons who begged within the district, that they would be sent to\\r , jail.  This frightened Oliver very much, and made him glad to get out\\r , of those villages with all possible expedition.  In others, he would\\r , stand about the inn-yards, and look mournfully at every one who passed:\\r , a proceeding which generally terminated in the landlady\\'s ordering one\\r , of the post-boys who were lounging about, to drive that strange boy out\\r , of the place, for she was sure he had come to steal something.  If he\\r , begged at a farmer\\'s house, ten to one but they threatened to set the\\r , dog on him; and when he showed his nose in a shop, they talked about\\r , the beadle--which brought Oliver\\'s heart into his mouth,--very often\\r , the only thing he had there, for many hours together.\\r , \\r , In fact, if it had not been for a good-hearted turnpike-man, and a\\r , benevolent old lady, Oliver\\'s troubles would have been shortened by the\\r , very same process which had put an end to his mother\\'s; in other words,\\r , he would most assuredly have fallen dead upon the king\\'s highway.  But\\r , the turnpike-man gave him a meal of bread and cheese; and the old lady,\\r , who had a shipwrecked grandson wandering barefoot in some distant part\\r , of the earth, took pity upon the poor orphan, and gave him what little\\r , she could afford--and more--with such kind and gentle words, and such\\r , tears of sympathy and compassion, that they sank deeper into Oliver\\'s\\r , soul, than all the sufferings he had ever undergone.\\r , \\r , Early on the seventh morning after he had left his native place, Oliver\\r , limped slowly into the little town of Barnet. The window-shutters were\\r , closed; the street was empty; not a soul had awakened to the business\\r , of the day.  The sun was rising in all its splendid beauty; but the\\r , light only served to show the boy his own lonesomeness and desolation,\\r , as he sat, with bleeding feet and covered with dust, upon a door-step.\\r , \\r , By degrees, the shutters were opened; the window-blinds were drawn up;\\r , and people began passing to and fro.  Some few stopped to gaze at\\r , Oliver for a moment or two, or turned round to stare at him as they\\r , hurried by; but none relieved him, or troubled themselves to inquire\\r , how he came there. He had no heart to beg. And there he sat.\\r , \\r , He had been crouching on the step for some time: wondering at the great\\r , number of public-houses (every other house in Barnet was a tavern,\\r , large or small), gazing listlessly at the coaches as they passed\\r , through, and thinking how strange it seemed that they could do, with\\r , ease, in a few hours, what it had taken him a whole week of courage and\\r , determination beyond his years to accomplish: when he was roused by\\r , observing that a boy, who had passed him carelessly some minutes\\r , before, had returned, and was now surveying him most earnestly from the\\r , opposite side of the way.  He took little heed of this at first; but\\r , the boy remained in the same attitude of close observation so long,\\r , that Oliver raised his head, and returned his steady look.  Upon this,\\r , the boy crossed over; and walking close up to Oliver, said,\\r , \\r , \\'Hullo, my covey!  What\\'s the row?\\'\\r , \\r , The boy who addressed this inquiry to the young wayfarer, was about his\\r , own age: but one of the queerest looking boys that Oliver had even\\r , seen.  He was a snub-nosed, flat-browed, common-faced boy enough; and\\r , as dirty a juvenile as one would wish to see; but he had about him all\\r , the airs and manners of a man.  He was short of his age: with rather\\r , bow-legs, and little, sharp, ugly eyes.  His hat was stuck on the top\\r , of his head so lightly, that it threatened to fall off every\\r , moment--and would have done so, very often, if the wearer had not had a\\r , knack of every now and then giving his head a sudden twitch, which\\r , brought it back to its old place again.  He wore a man\\'s coat, which\\r , reached nearly to his heels.  He had turned the cuffs back, half-way up\\r , his arm, to get his hands out of the sleeves: apparently with the\\r , ultimate view of thrusting them into the pockets of his corduroy\\r , trousers; for there he kept them.  He was, altogether, as roystering\\r , and swaggering a young gentleman as ever stood four feet six, or\\r , something less, in the bluchers.\\r , \\r , \\'Hullo, my covey!  What\\'s the row?\\' said this strange young gentleman\\r , to Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'I am very hungry and tired,\\' replied Oliver: the tears standing in his\\r , eyes as he spoke. \\'I have walked a long way.  I have been walking these\\r , seven days.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Walking for sivin days!\\' said the young gentleman.  \\'Oh, I see. Beak\\'s\\r , order, eh?  But,\\' he added, noticing Oliver\\'s look of surprise, \\'I\\r , suppose you don\\'t know what a beak is, my flash com-pan-i-on.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver mildly replied, that he had always heard a bird\\'s mouth\\r , described by the term in question.\\r , \\r , \\'My eyes, how green!\\' exclaimed the young gentleman. \\'Why, a beak\\'s a\\r , madgst\\'rate; and when you walk by a beak\\'s order, it\\'s not straight\\r , forerd, but always agoing up, and niver a coming down agin.  Was you\\r , never on the mill?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What mill?\\' inquired Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'What mill!  Why, _the_ mill--the mill as takes up so little room that\\r , it\\'ll work inside a Stone Jug; and always goes better when the wind\\'s\\r , low with people, than when it\\'s high; acos then they can\\'t get workmen.\\r , But come,\\' said the young gentleman; \\'you want grub, and you shall have\\r , it.  I\\'m at low-water-mark myself--only one bob and a magpie; but, as\\r , far as it goes, I\\'ll fork out and stump.  Up with you on your pins.\\r , There!  Now then! \\'Morrice!\\'\\r , \\r , Assisting Oliver to rise, the young gentleman took him to an adjacent\\r , chandler\\'s shop, where he purchased a sufficiency of ready-dressed ham\\r , and a half-quartern loaf, or, as he himself expressed it, \\'a fourpenny\\r , bran!\\' the ham being kept clean and preserved from dust, by the\\r , ingenious expedient of making a hole in the loaf by pulling out a\\r , portion of the crumb, and stuffing it therein.  Taking the bread under\\r , his arm, the young gentlman turned into a small public-house, and led\\r , the way to a tap-room in the rear of the premises. Here, a pot of beer\\r , was brought in, by direction of the mysterious youth; and Oliver,\\r , falling to, at his new friend\\'s bidding, made a long and hearty meal,\\r , during the progress of which the strange boy eyed him from time to time\\r , with great attention.\\r , \\r , \\'Going to London?\\' said the strange boy, when Oliver had at length\\r , concluded.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Got any lodgings?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Money?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No.\\'\\r , \\r , The strange boy whistled; and put his arms into his pockets, as far as\\r , the big coat-sleeves would let them go.\\r , \\r , \\'Do you live in London?\\' inquired Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes. I do, when I\\'m at home,\\' replied the boy. \\'I suppose you want\\r , some place to sleep in to-night, don\\'t you?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I do, indeed,\\' answered Oliver. \\'I have not slept under a roof since I\\r , left the country.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t fret your eyelids on that score,\\' said the young gentleman.\\r , \\'I\\'ve got to be in London to-night; and I know a \\'spectable old\\r , gentleman as lives there, wot\\'ll give you lodgings for nothink, and\\r , never ask for the change--that is, if any genelman he knows interduces\\r , you. And don\\'t he know me?  Oh, no! Not in the least!  By no means.\\r , Certainly not!\\'\\r , \\r , The young gentleman smiled, as if to intimate that the latter fragments\\r , of discourse were playfully ironical; and finished the beer as he did\\r , so.\\r , \\r , This unexpected offer of shelter was too tempting to be resisted;\\r , especially as it was immediately followed up, by the assurance that the\\r , old gentleman referred to, would doubtless provide Oliver with a\\r , comfortable place, without loss of time.  This led to a more friendly\\r , and confidential dialogue; from which Oliver discovered that his\\r , friend\\'s name was Jack Dawkins, and that he was a peculiar pet and\\r , protege of the elderly gentleman before mentioned.\\r , \\r , Mr. Dawkin\\'s appearance did not say a vast deal in favour of the\\r , comforts which his patron\\'s interest obtained for those whom he took\\r , under his protection; but, as he had a rather flightly and dissolute\\r , mode of conversing, and furthermore avowed that among his intimate\\r , friends he was better known by the sobriquet of \\'The Artful Dodger,\\'\\r , Oliver concluded that, being of a dissipated and careless turn, the\\r , moral precepts of his benefactor had hitherto been thrown away upon\\r , him.  Under this impression, he secretly resolved to cultivate the good\\r , opinion of the old gentleman as quickly as possible; and, if he found\\r , the Dodger incorrigible, as he more than half suspected he should, to\\r , decline the honour of his farther acquaintance.\\r , \\r , As John Dawkins objected to their entering London before nightfall, it\\r , was nearly eleven o\\'clock when they reached the turnpike at Islington.\\r , They crossed from the Angel into St. John\\'s Road; struck down the small\\r , street which terminates at Sadler\\'s Wells Theatre; through Exmouth\\r , Street and Coppice Row; down the little court by the side of the\\r , workhouse; across the classic ground which once bore the name of\\r , Hockley-in-the-Hole; thence into Little Saffron Hill; and so into\\r , Saffron Hill the Great: along which the Dodger scudded at a rapid pace,\\r , directing Oliver to follow close at his heels.\\r , \\r , Although Oliver had enough to occupy his attention in keeping sight of\\r , his leader, he could not help bestowing a few hasty glances on either\\r , side of the way, as he passed along.  A dirtier or more wretched place\\r , he had never seen.  The street was very narrow and muddy, and the air\\r , was impregnated with filthy odours.\\r , \\r , There were a good many small shops; but the only stock in trade\\r , appeared to be heaps of children, who, even at that time of night, were\\r , crawling in and out at the doors, or screaming from the inside.  The\\r , sole places that seemed to prosper amid the general blight of the\\r , place, were the public-houses; and in them, the lowest orders of Irish\\r , were wrangling with might and main. Covered ways and yards, which here\\r , and there diverged from the main street, disclosed little knots of\\r , houses, where drunken men and women were positively wallowing in filth;\\r , and from several of the door-ways, great ill-looking fellows were\\r , cautiously emerging, bound, to all appearance, on no very well-disposed\\r , or harmless errands.\\r , \\r , Oliver was just considering whether he hadn\\'t better run away, when\\r , they reached the bottom of the hill.  His conductor, catching him by\\r , the arm, pushed open the door of a house near Field Lane; and drawing\\r , him into the passage, closed it behind them.\\r , \\r , \\'Now, then!\\' cried a voice from below, in reply to a whistle from the\\r , Dodger.\\r , \\r , \\'Plummy and slam!\\' was the reply.\\r , \\r , This seemed to be some watchword or signal that all was right; for the\\r , light of a feeble candle gleamed on the wall at the remote end of the\\r , passage; and a man\\'s face peeped out, from where a balustrade of the\\r , old kitchen staircase had been broken away.\\r , \\r , \\'There\\'s two on you,\\' said the man, thrusting the candle farther out,\\r , and shielding his eyes with his hand.  \\'Who\\'s the t\\'other one?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'A new pal,\\' replied Jack Dawkins, pulling Oliver forward.\\r , \\r , \\'Where did he come from?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Greenland. Is Fagin upstairs?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, he\\'s a sortin\\' the wipes.  Up with you!\\'  The candle was drawn\\r , back, and the face disappeared.\\r , \\r , Oliver, groping his way with one hand, and having the other firmly\\r , grasped by his companion, ascended with much difficulty the dark and\\r , broken stairs: which his conductor mounted with an ease and expedition\\r , that showed he was well acquainted with them.\\r , \\r , He threw open the door of a back-room, and drew Oliver in after him.\\r , \\r , The walls and ceiling of the room were perfectly black with age and\\r , dirt.  There was a deal table before the fire: upon which were a\\r , candle, stuck in a ginger-beer bottle, two or three pewter pots, a loaf\\r , and butter, and a plate.  In a frying-pan, which was on the fire, and\\r , which was secured to the mantelshelf by a string, some sausages were\\r , cooking; and standing over them, with a toasting-fork in his hand, was\\r , a very old shrivelled Jew, whose villainous-looking and repulsive face\\r , was obscured by a quantity of matted red hair. He was dressed in a\\r , greasy flannel gown, with his throat bare; and seemed to be dividing\\r , his attention between the frying-pan and the clothes-horse, over which\\r , a great number of silk handkerchiefs were hanging.  Several rough beds\\r , made of old sacks, were huddled side by side on the floor. Seated round\\r , the table were four or five boys, none older than the Dodger, smoking\\r , long clay pipes, and drinking spirits with the air of middle-aged men.\\r , These all crowded about their associate as he whispered a few words to\\r , the Jew; and then turned round and grinned at Oliver.  So did the Jew\\r , himself, toasting-fork in hand.\\r , \\r , \\'This is him, Fagin,\\' said Jack Dawkins;\\'my friend Oliver Twist.\\'\\r , \\r , The Jew grinned; and, making a low obeisance to Oliver, took him by the\\r , hand, and hoped he should have the honour of his intimate acquaintance.\\r , Upon this, the young gentleman with the pipes came round him, and shook\\r , both his hands very hard--especially the one in which he held his\\r , little bundle.  One young gentleman was very anxious to hang up his cap\\r , for him; and another was so obliging as to put his hands in his\\r , pockets, in order that, as he was very tired, he might not have the\\r , trouble of emptying them, himself, when he went to bed.  These\\r , civilities would probably be extended much farther, but for a liberal\\r , exercise of the Jew\\'s toasting-fork on the heads and shoulders of the\\r , affectionate youths who offered them.\\r , \\r , \\'We are very glad to see you, Oliver, very,\\' said the Jew. \\'Dodger,\\r , take off the sausages; and draw a tub near the fire for Oliver.  Ah,\\r , you\\'re a-staring at the pocket-handkerchiefs! eh, my dear. There are a\\r , good many of \\'em, ain\\'t there? We\\'ve just looked \\'em out, ready for the\\r , wash; that\\'s all, Oliver; that\\'s all. Ha! ha! ha!\\'\\r , \\r , The latter part of this speech, was hailed by a boisterous shout from\\r , all the hopeful pupils of the merry old gentleman. In the midst of\\r , which they went to supper.\\r , \\r , Oliver ate his share, and the Jew then mixed him a glass of hot\\r , gin-and-water: telling him he must drink it off directly, because\\r , another gentleman wanted the tumbler. Oliver did as he was desired.\\r , Immediately afterwards he felt himself gently lifted on to one of the\\r , sacks; and then he sunk into a deep sleep.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER IX\\r , \\r , CONTAINING FURTHER PARTICULARS CONCERNING THE PLEASANT OLD GENTLEMAN,\\r , AND HIS HOPEFUL PUPILS\\r , \\r , It was late next morning when Oliver awoke, from a sound, long sleep.\\r , There was no other person in the room but the old Jew, who was boiling\\r , some coffee in a saucepan for breakfast, and whistling softly to\\r , himself as he stirred it round and round, with an iron spoon. He would\\r , stop every now and then to listen when there was the least noise below:\\r , and when he had satisfied himself, he would go on whistling and\\r , stirring again, as before.\\r , \\r , Although Oliver had roused himself from sleep, he was not thoroughly\\r , awake. There is a drowsy state, between sleeping and waking, when you\\r , dream more in five minutes with your eyes half open, and yourself half\\r , conscious of everything that is passing around you, than you would in\\r , five nights with your eyes fast closed, and your senses wrapt in\\r , perfect unconsciousness. At such time, a mortal knows just enough of\\r , what his mind is doing, to form some glimmering conception of its\\r , mighty powers, its bounding from earth and spurning time and space,\\r , when freed from the restraint of its corporeal associate.\\r , \\r , Oliver was precisely in this condition. He saw the Jew with his\\r , half-closed eyes; heard his low whistling; and recognised the sound of\\r , the spoon grating against the saucepan\\'s sides: and yet the self-same\\r , senses were mentally engaged, at the same time, in busy action with\\r , almost everybody he had ever known.\\r , \\r , When the coffee was done, the Jew drew the saucepan to the hob.\\r , Standing, then in an irresolute attitude for a few minutes, as if he\\r , did not well know how to employ himself, he turned round and looked at\\r , Oliver, and called him by his name. He did not answer, and was to all\\r , appearances asleep.\\r , \\r , After satisfying himself upon this head, the Jew stepped gently to the\\r , door: which he fastened. He then drew forth: as it seemed to Oliver,\\r , from some trap in the floor: a small box, which he placed carefully on\\r , the table. His eyes glistened as he raised the lid, and looked in.\\r , Dragging an old chair to the table, he sat down; and took from it a\\r , magnificent gold watch, sparkling with jewels.\\r , \\r , \\'Aha!\\' said the Jew, shrugging up his shoulders, and distorting every\\r , feature with a hideous grin. \\'Clever dogs! Clever dogs! Staunch to the\\r , last! Never told the old parson where they were. Never poached upon old\\r , Fagin! And why should they? It wouldn\\'t have loosened the knot, or kept\\r , the drop up, a minute longer. No, no, no! Fine fellows! Fine fellows!\\'\\r , \\r , With these, and other muttered reflections of the like nature, the Jew\\r , once more deposited the watch in its place of safety. At least half a\\r , dozen more were severally drawn forth from the same box, and surveyed\\r , with equal pleasure; besides rings, brooches, bracelets, and other\\r , articles of jewellery, of such magnificent materials, and costly\\r , workmanship, that Oliver had no idea, even of their names.\\r , \\r , Having replaced these trinkets, the Jew took out another: so small that\\r , it lay in the palm of his hand. There seemed to be some very minute\\r , inscription on it; for the Jew laid it flat upon the table, and shading\\r , it with his hand, pored over it, long and earnestly. At length he put\\r , it down, as if despairing of success; and, leaning back in his chair,\\r , muttered:\\r , \\r , \\'What a fine thing capital punishment is! Dead men never repent; dead\\r , men never bring awkward stories to light. Ah, it\\'s a fine thing for the\\r , trade! Five of \\'em strung up in a row, and none left to play booty, or\\r , turn white-livered!\\'\\r , \\r , As the Jew uttered these words, his bright dark eyes, which had been\\r , staring vacantly before him, fell on Oliver\\'s face; the boy\\'s eyes were\\r , fixed on his in mute curiousity; and although the recognition was only\\r , for an instant--for the briefest space of time that can possibly be\\r , conceived--it was enough to show the old man that he had been observed.\\r , \\r , He closed the lid of the box with a loud crash; and, laying his hand on\\r , a bread knife which was on the table, started furiously up. He trembled\\r , very much though; for, even in his terror, Oliver could see that the\\r , knife quivered in the air.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s that?\\' said the Jew. \\'What do you watch me for? Why are you\\r , awake? What have you seen? Speak out, boy! Quick--quick! for your life.\\r , \\r , \\'I wasn\\'t able to sleep any longer, sir,\\' replied Oliver, meekly. \\'I am\\r , very sorry if I have disturbed you, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You were not awake an hour ago?\\' said the Jew, scowling fiercely on\\r , the boy.\\r , \\r , \\'No! No, indeed!\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Are you sure?\\' cried the Jew: with a still fiercer look than before:\\r , and a threatening attitude.\\r , \\r , \\'Upon my word I was not, sir,\\' replied Oliver, earnestly. \\'I was not,\\r , indeed, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Tush, tush, my dear!\\' said the Jew, abruptly resuming his old manner,\\r , and playing with the knife a little, before he laid it down; as if to\\r , induce the belief that he had caught it up, in mere sport. \\'Of course I\\r , know that, my dear. I only tried to frighten you. You\\'re a brave boy.\\r , Ha! ha! you\\'re a brave boy, Oliver.\\' The Jew rubbed his hands with a\\r , chuckle, but glanced uneasily at the box, notwithstanding.\\r , \\r , \\'Did you see any of these pretty things, my dear?\\' said the Jew, laying\\r , his hand upon it after a short pause.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, sir,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!\\' said the Jew, turning rather pale. \\'They--they\\'re mine, Oliver;\\r , my little property. All I have to live upon, in my old age. The folks\\r , call me a miser, my dear. Only a miser; that\\'s all.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver thought the old gentleman must be a decided miser to live in\\r , such a dirty place, with so many watches; but, thinking that perhaps\\r , his fondness for the Dodger and the other boys, cost him a good deal of\\r , money, he only cast a deferential look at the Jew, and asked if he\\r , might get up.\\r , \\r , \\'Certainly, my dear, certainly,\\' replied the old gentleman. \\'Stay.\\r , There\\'s a pitcher of water in the corner by the door. Bring it here;\\r , and I\\'ll give you a basin to wash in, my dear.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver got up; walked across the room; and stooped for an instant to\\r , raise the pitcher.  When he turned his head, the box was gone.\\r , \\r , He had scarcely washed himself, and made everything tidy, by emptying\\r , the basin out of the window, agreeably to the Jew\\'s directions, when\\r , the Dodger returned: accompanied by a very sprightly young friend, whom\\r , Oliver had seen smoking on the previous night, and who was now formally\\r , introduced to him as Charley Bates. The four sat down, to breakfast, on\\r , the coffee, and some hot rolls and ham which the Dodger had brought\\r , home in the crown of his hat.\\r , \\r , \\'Well,\\' said the Jew, glancing slyly at Oliver, and addressing himself\\r , to the Dodger, \\'I hope you\\'ve been at work this morning, my dears?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hard,\\' replied the Dodger.\\r , \\r , \\'As nails,\\' added Charley Bates.\\r , \\r , \\'Good boys, good boys!\\' said the Jew. \\'What have you got, Dodger?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'A couple of pocket-books,\\' replied that young gentlman.\\r , \\r , \\'Lined?\\' inquired the Jew, with eagerness.\\r , \\r , \\'Pretty well,\\' replied the Dodger, producing two pocket-books; one\\r , green, and the other red.\\r , \\r , \\'Not so heavy as they might be,\\' said the Jew, after looking at the\\r , insides carefully; \\'but very neat and nicely made.  Ingenious workman,\\r , ain\\'t he, Oliver?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Very indeed, sir,\\' said Oliver. At which Mr. Charles Bates laughed\\r , uproariously; very much to the amazement of Oliver, who saw nothing to\\r , laugh at, in anything that had passed.\\r , \\r , \\'And what have you got, my dear?\\' said Fagin to Charley Bates.\\r , \\r , \\'Wipes,\\' replied Master Bates; at the same time producing four\\r , pocket-handkerchiefs.\\r , \\r , \\'Well,\\' said the Jew, inspecting them closely; \\'they\\'re very good ones,\\r , very. You haven\\'t marked them well, though, Charley; so the marks shall\\r , be picked out with a needle, and we\\'ll teach Oliver how to do it. Shall\\r , us, Oliver, eh? Ha! ha! ha!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If you please, sir,\\' said Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'d like to be able to make pocket-handkerchiefs as easy as Charley\\r , Bates, wouldn\\'t you, my dear?\\' said the Jew.\\r , \\r , \\'Very much, indeed, if you\\'ll teach me, sir,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , Master Bates saw something so exquisitely ludicrous in this reply, that\\r , he burst into another laugh; which laugh, meeting the coffee he was\\r , drinking, and carrying it down some wrong channel, very nearly\\r , terminated in his premature suffocation.\\r , \\r , \\'He is so jolly green!\\' said Charley when he recovered, as an apology\\r , to the company for his unpolite behaviour.\\r , \\r , The Dodger said nothing, but he smoothed Oliver\\'s hair over his eyes,\\r , and said he\\'d know better, by and by; upon which the old gentleman,\\r , observing Oliver\\'s colour mounting, changed the subject by asking\\r , whether there had been much of a crowd at the execution that morning?\\r , This made him wonder more and more; for it was plain from the replies\\r , of the two boys that they had both been there; and Oliver naturally\\r , wondered how they could possibly have found time to be so very\\r , industrious.\\r , \\r , When the breakfast was cleared away; the merry old gentlman and the two\\r , boys played at a very curious and uncommon game, which was performed in\\r , this way. The merry old gentleman, placing a snuff-box in one pocket of\\r , his trousers, a note-case in the other, and a watch in his waistcoat\\r , pocket, with a guard-chain round his neck, and sticking a mock diamond\\r , pin in his shirt: buttoned his coat tight round him, and putting his\\r , spectacle-case and handkerchief in his pockets, trotted up and down the\\r , room with a stick, in imitation of the manner in which old gentlemen\\r , walk about the streets any hour in the day.  Sometimes he stopped at\\r , the fire-place, and sometimes at the door, making believe that he was\\r , staring with all his might into shop-windows.  At such times, he would\\r , look constantly round him, for fear of thieves, and would keep slapping\\r , all his pockets in turn, to see that he hadn\\'t lost anything, in such a\\r , very funny and natural manner, that Oliver laughed till the tears ran\\r , down his face.  All this time, the two boys followed him closely about:\\r , getting out of his sight, so nimbly, every time he turned round, that\\r , it was impossible to follow their motions. At last, the Dodger trod\\r , upon his toes, or ran upon his boot accidently, while Charley Bates\\r , stumbled up against him behind; and in that one moment they took from\\r , him, with the most extraordinary rapidity, snuff-box, note-case,\\r , watch-guard, chain, shirt-pin, pocket-handkerchief, even the\\r , spectacle-case.  If the old gentlman felt a hand in any one of his\\r , pockets, he cried out where it was; and then the game began all over\\r , again.\\r , \\r , When this game had been played a great many times, a couple of young\\r , ladies called to see the young gentleman; one of whom was named Bet,\\r , and the other Nancy.  They wore a good deal of hair, not very neatly\\r , turned up behind, and were rather untidy about the shoes and stockings.\\r , They were not exactly pretty, perhaps; but they had a great deal of\\r , colour in their faces, and looked quite stout and hearty.  Being\\r , remarkably free and agreeable in their manners, Oliver thought them\\r , very nice girls indeed.  As there is no doubt they were.\\r , \\r , The visitors stopped a long time. Spirits were produced, in consequence\\r , of one of the young ladies complaining of a coldness in her inside; and\\r , the conversation took a very convivial and improving turn. At length,\\r , Charley Bates expressed his opinion that it was time to pad the hoof.\\r , This, it occurred to Oliver, must be French for going out; for directly\\r , afterwards, the Dodger, and Charley, and the two young ladies, went\\r , away together, having been kindly furnished by the amiable old Jew with\\r , money to spend.\\r , \\r , \\'There, my dear,\\' said Fagin. \\'That\\'s a pleasant life, isn\\'t it? They\\r , have gone out for the day.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Have they done work, sir?\\' inquired Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' said the Jew; \\'that is, unless they should unexpectedly come\\r , across any, when they are out; and they won\\'t neglect it, if they do,\\r , my dear, depend upon it.  Make \\'em your models, my dear. Make \\'em your\\r , models,\\' tapping the fire-shovel on the hearth to add force to his\\r , words; \\'do everything they bid you, and take their advice in all\\r , matters--especially the Dodger\\'s, my dear. He\\'ll be a great man\\r , himself, and will make you one too, if you take pattern by him.--Is my\\r , handkerchief hanging out of my pocket, my dear?\\' said the Jew, stopping\\r , short.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, sir,\\' said Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'See if you can take it out, without my feeling it; as you saw them do,\\r , when we were at play this morning.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver held up the bottom of the pocket with one hand, as he had seen\\r , the Dodger hold it, and drew the handkerchief lightly out of it with\\r , the other.\\r , \\r , \\'Is it gone?\\' cried the Jew.\\r , \\r , \\'Here it is, sir,\\' said Oliver, showing it in his hand.\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'re a clever boy, my dear,\\' said the playful old gentleman, patting\\r , Oliver on the head approvingly. \\'I never saw a sharper lad. Here\\'s a\\r , shilling for you. If you go on, in this way, you\\'ll be the greatest man\\r , of the time. And now come here, and I\\'ll show you how to take the marks\\r , out of the handkerchiefs.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver wondered what picking the old gentleman\\'s pocket in play, had to\\r , do with his chances of being a great man.  But, thinking that the Jew,\\r , being so much his senior, must know best, he followed him quietly to\\r , the table, and was soon deeply involved in his new study.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER X\\r , \\r , OLIVER BECOMES BETTER ACQUAINTED WITH THE CHARACTERS OF HIS NEW\\r , ASSOCIATES; AND PURCHASES EXPERIENCE AT A HIGH PRICE. BEING A SHORT,\\r , BUT VERY IMPORTANT CHAPTER, IN THIS HISTORY\\r , \\r , For many days, Oliver remained in the Jew\\'s room, picking the marks out\\r , of the pocket-handkerchief, (of which a great number were brought\\r , home,) and sometimes taking part in the game already described: which\\r , the two boys and the Jew played, regularly, every morning. At length,\\r , he began to languish for fresh air, and took many occasions of\\r , earnestly entreating the old gentleman to allow him to go out to work\\r , with his two companions.\\r , \\r , Oliver was rendered the more anxious to be actively employed, by what\\r , he had seen of the stern morality of the old gentleman\\'s character.\\r , Whenever the Dodger or Charley Bates came home at night, empty-handed,\\r , he would expatiate with great vehemence on the misery of idle and lazy\\r , habits; and would enforce upon them the necessity of an active life, by\\r , sending them supperless to bed. On one occasion, indeed, he even went\\r , so far as to knock them both down a flight of stairs; but this was\\r , carrying out his virtuous precepts to an unusual extent.\\r , \\r , At length, one morning, Oliver obtained the permission he had so\\r , eagerly sought. There had been no handkerchiefs to work upon, for two\\r , or three days, and the dinners had been rather meagre. Perhaps these\\r , were reasons for the old gentleman\\'s giving his assent; but, whether\\r , they were or no, he told Oliver he might go, and placed him under the\\r , joint guardianship of Charley Bates, and his friend the Dodger.\\r , \\r , The three boys sallied out; the Dodger with his coat-sleeves tucked up,\\r , and his hat cocked, as usual; Master Bates sauntering along with his\\r , hands in his pockets; and Oliver between them, wondering where they\\r , were going, and what branch of manufacture he would be instructed in,\\r , first.\\r , \\r , The pace at which they went, was such a very lazy, ill-looking saunter,\\r , that Oliver soon began to think his companions were going to deceive\\r , the old gentleman, by not going to work at all. The Dodger had a\\r , vicious propensity, too, of pulling the caps from the heads of small\\r , boys and tossing them down areas; while Charley Bates exhibited some\\r , very loose notions concerning the rights of property, by pilfering\\r , divers apples and onions from the stalls at the kennel sides, and\\r , thrusting them into pockets which were so surprisingly capacious, that\\r , they seemed to undermine his whole suit of clothes in every direction.\\r , These things looked so bad, that Oliver was on the point of declaring\\r , his intention of seeking his way back, in the best way he could; when\\r , his thoughts were suddenly directed into another channel, by a very\\r , mysterious change of behaviour on the part of the Dodger.\\r , \\r , They were just emerging from a narrow court not far from the open\\r , square in Clerkenwell, which is yet called, by some strange perversion\\r , of terms, \\'The Green\\': when the Dodger made a sudden stop; and, laying\\r , his finger on his lip, drew his companions back again, with the\\r , greatest caution and circumspection.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s the matter?\\' demanded Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Hush!\\' replied the Dodger. \\'Do you see that old cove at the\\r , book-stall?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The old gentleman over the way?\\' said Oliver. \\'Yes, I see him.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He\\'ll do,\\' said the Dodger.\\r , \\r , \\'A prime plant,\\' observed Master Charley Bates.\\r , \\r , Oliver looked from one to the other, with the greatest surprise; but he\\r , was not permitted to make any inquiries; for the two boys walked\\r , stealthily across the road, and slunk close behind the old gentleman\\r , towards whom his attention had been directed. Oliver walked a few paces\\r , after them; and, not knowing whether to advance or retire, stood\\r , looking on in silent amazement.\\r , \\r , The old gentleman was a very respectable-looking personage, with a\\r , powdered head and gold spectacles. He was dressed in a bottle-green\\r , coat with a black velvet collar; wore white trousers; and carried a\\r , smart bamboo cane under his arm. He had taken up a book from the stall,\\r , and there he stood, reading away, as hard as if he were in his\\r , elbow-chair, in his own study. It is very possible that he fancied\\r , himself there, indeed; for it was plain, from his abstraction, that he\\r , saw not the book-stall, nor the street, nor the boys, nor, in short,\\r , anything but the book itself: which he was reading straight through:\\r , turning over the leaf when he got to the bottom of a page, beginning at\\r , the top line of the next one, and going regularly on, with the greatest\\r , interest and eagerness.\\r , \\r , What was Oliver\\'s horror and alarm as he stood a few paces off, looking\\r , on with his eyelids as wide open as they would possibly go, to see the\\r , Dodger plunge his hand into the old gentleman\\'s pocket, and draw from\\r , thence a handkerchief! To see him hand the same to Charley Bates; and\\r , finally to behold them, both running away round the corner at full\\r , speed!\\r , \\r , In an instant the whole mystery of the hankerchiefs, and the watches,\\r , and the jewels, and the Jew, rushed upon the boy\\'s mind.\\r , \\r , He stood, for a moment, with the blood so tingling through all his\\r , veins from terror, that he felt as if he were in a burning fire; then,\\r , confused and frightened, he took to his heels; and, not knowing what he\\r , did, made off as fast as he could lay his feet to the ground.\\r , \\r , This was all done in a minute\\'s space. In the very instant when Oliver\\r , began to run, the old gentleman, putting his hand to his pocket, and\\r , missing his handkerchief, turned sharp round. Seeing the boy scudding\\r , away at such a rapid pace, he very naturally concluded him to be the\\r , depredator; and shouting \\'Stop thief!\\' with all his might, made off\\r , after him, book in hand.\\r , \\r , But the old gentleman was not the only person who raised the\\r , hue-and-cry. The Dodger and Master Bates, unwilling to attract public\\r , attention by running down the open street, had merely retired into the\\r , very first doorway round the corner. They no sooner heard the cry, and\\r , saw Oliver running, than, guessing exactly how the matter stood, they\\r , issued forth with great promptitude; and, shouting \\'Stop thief!\\' too,\\r , joined in the pursuit like good citizens.\\r , \\r , Although Oliver had been brought up by philosophers, he was not\\r , theoretically acquainted with the beautiful axiom that\\r , self-preservation is the first law of nature. If he had been, perhaps\\r , he would have been prepared for this. Not being prepared, however, it\\r , alarmed him the more; so away he went like the wind, with the old\\r , gentleman and the two boys roaring and shouting behind him.\\r , \\r , \\'Stop thief! Stop thief!\\' There is a magic in the sound. The tradesman\\r , leaves his counter, and the car-man his waggon; the butcher throws down\\r , his tray; the baker his basket; the milkman his pail; the errand-boy\\r , his parcels; the school-boy his marbles; the paviour his pickaxe; the\\r , child his battledore. Away they run, pell-mell, helter-skelter,\\r , slap-dash: tearing, yelling, screaming, knocking down the passengers as\\r , they turn the corners, rousing up the dogs, and astonishing the fowls:\\r , and streets, squares, and courts, re-echo with the sound.\\r , \\r , \\'Stop thief! Stop thief!\\' The cry is taken up by a hundred voices, and\\r , the crowd accumulate at every turning. Away they fly, splashing through\\r , the mud, and rattling along the pavements: up go the windows, out run\\r , the people, onward bear the mob, a whole audience desert Punch in the\\r , very thickest of the plot, and, joining the rushing throng, swell the\\r , shout, and lend fresh vigour to the cry, \\'Stop thief! Stop thief!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Stop thief! Stop thief!\\' There is a passion FOR _hunting_ _something_\\r , deeply implanted in the human breast.  One wretched breathless child,\\r , panting with exhaustion; terror in his looks; agony in his eyes; large\\r , drops of perspiration streaming down his face; strains every nerve to\\r , make head upon his pursuers; and as they follow on his track, and gain\\r , upon him every instant, they hail his decreasing strength with joy.\\r , \\'Stop thief!\\'  Ay, stop him for God\\'s sake, were it only in mercy!\\r , \\r , Stopped at last!  A clever blow.  He is down upon the pavement; and the\\r , crowd eagerly gather round him:  each new comer, jostling and\\r , struggling with the others to catch a glimpse.  \\'Stand aside!\\'  \\'Give\\r , him a little air!\\'  \\'Nonsense! he don\\'t deserve it.\\'  \\'Where\\'s the\\r , gentleman?\\'  \\'Here his is, coming down the street.\\'  \\'Make room there\\r , for the gentleman!\\' \\'Is this the boy, sir!\\'  \\'Yes.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver lay, covered with mud and dust, and bleeding from the mouth,\\r , looking wildly round upon the heap of faces that surrounded him, when\\r , the old gentleman was officiously dragged and pushed into the circle by\\r , the foremost of the pursuers.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' said the gentleman, \\'I am afraid it is the boy.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Afraid!\\' murmured the crowd.  \\'That\\'s a good \\'un!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Poor fellow!\\' said the gentleman, \\'he has hurt himself.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'_I_ did that, sir,\\' said a great lubberly fellow, stepping forward;\\r , \\'and preciously I cut my knuckle agin\\' his mouth.  I stopped him, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , The fellow touched his hat with a grin, expecting something for his\\r , pains; but, the old gentleman, eyeing him with an expression of\\r , dislike, look anxiously round, as if he contemplated running away\\r , himself:  which it is very possible he might have attempted to do, and\\r , thus have afforded another chase, had not a police officer (who is\\r , generally the last person to arrive in such cases) at that moment made\\r , his way through the crowd, and seized Oliver by the collar.\\r , \\r , \\'Come, get up,\\' said the man, roughly.\\r , \\r , \\'It wasn\\'t me indeed, sir.  Indeed, indeed, it was two other boys,\\'\\r , said Oliver, clasping his hands passionately, and looking round.  \\'They\\r , are here somewhere.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh no, they ain\\'t,\\' said the officer.  He meant this to be ironical,\\r , but it was true besides; for the Dodger and Charley Bates had filed off\\r , down the first convenient court they came to.\\r , \\r , \\'Come, get up!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t hurt him,\\' said the old gentleman, compassionately.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh no, I won\\'t hurt him,\\' replied the officer, tearing his jacket half\\r , off his back, in proof thereof.  \\'Come, I know you; it won\\'t do.  Will\\r , you stand upon your legs, you young devil?\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver, who could hardly stand, made a shift to raise himself on his\\r , feet, and was at once lugged along the streets by the jacket-collar, at\\r , a rapid pace.  The gentleman walked on with them by the officer\\'s side;\\r , and as many of the crowd as could achieve the feat, got a little ahead,\\r , and stared back at Oliver from time to time.  The boys shouted in\\r , triumph; and on they went.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XI\\r , \\r , TREATS OF MR. FANG THE POLICE MAGISTRATE; AND FURNISHES A SLIGHT\\r , SPECIMEN OF HIS MODE OF ADMINISTERING JUSTICE\\r , \\r , The offence had been committed within the district, and indeed in the\\r , immediate neighborhood of, a very notorious metropolitan police office.\\r , The crowd had only the satisfaction of accompanying Oliver through two\\r , or three streets, and down a place called Mutton Hill, when he was led\\r , beneath a low archway, and up a dirty court, into this dispensary of\\r , summary justice, by the back way.  It was a small paved yard into which\\r , they turned; and here they encountered a stout man with a bunch of\\r , whiskers on his face, and a bunch of keys in his hand.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s the matter now?\\' said the man carelessly.\\r , \\r , \\'A young fogle-hunter,\\' replied the man who had Oliver in charge.\\r , \\r , \\'Are you the party that\\'s been robbed, sir?\\' inquired the man with the\\r , keys.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, I am,\\' replied the old gentleman; \\'but I am not sure that this\\r , boy actually took the handkerchief.  I--I would rather not press the\\r , case.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Must go before the magistrate now, sir,\\' replied the man. \\'His worship\\r , will be disengaged in half a minute.  Now, young gallows!\\'\\r , \\r , This was an invitation for Oliver to enter through a door which he\\r , unlocked as he spoke, and which led into a stone cell.  Here he was\\r , searched; and nothing being found upon him, locked up.\\r , \\r , This cell was in shape and size something like an area cellar, only not\\r , so light.  It was most intolerably dirty; for it was Monday morning;\\r , and it had been tenanted by six drunken people, who had been locked up,\\r , elsewhere, since Saturday night.  But this is little.  In our\\r , station-houses, men and women are every night confined on the most\\r , trivial charges--the word is worth noting--in dungeons, compared with\\r , which, those in Newgate, occupied by the most atrocious felons, tried,\\r , found guilty, and under sentence of death, are palaces. Let any one who\\r , doubts this, compare the two.\\r , \\r , The old gentleman looked almost as rueful as Oliver when the key grated\\r , in the lock.  He turned with a sigh to the book, which had been the\\r , innocent cause of all this disturbance.\\r , \\r , \\'There is something in that boy\\'s face,\\' said the old gentleman to\\r , himself as he walked slowly away, tapping his chin with the cover of\\r , the book, in a thoughtful manner; \\'something that touches and interests\\r , me.  _Can_ he be innocent?  He looked like--Bye the bye,\\' exclaimed the\\r , old gentleman, halting very abruptly, and staring up into the sky,\\r , \\'Bless my soul!--where have I seen something like that look before?\\'\\r , \\r , After musing for some minutes, the old gentleman walked, with the same\\r , meditative face, into a back anteroom opening from the yard; and there,\\r , retiring into a corner, called up before his mind\\'s eye a vast\\r , amphitheatre of faces over which a dusky curtain had hung for many\\r , years.  \\'No,\\' said the old gentleman, shaking his head; \\'it must be\\r , imagination.\\'\\r , \\r , He wandered over them again.  He had called them into view, and it was\\r , not easy to replace the shroud that had so long concealed them.  There\\r , were the faces of friends, and foes, and of many that had been almost\\r , strangers peering intrusively from the crowd; there were the faces of\\r , young and blooming girls that were now old women; there were faces that\\r , the grave had changed and closed upon, but which the mind, superior to\\r , its power, still dressed in their old freshness and beauty, calling\\r , back the lustre of the eyes, the brightness of the smile, the beaming\\r , of the soul through its mask of clay, and whispering of beauty beyond\\r , the tomb, changed but to be heightened, and taken from earth only to be\\r , set up as a light, to shed a soft and gentle glow upon the path to\\r , Heaven.\\r , \\r , But the old gentleman could recall no one countenance of which Oliver\\'s\\r , features bore a trace.  So, he heaved a sigh over the recollections he\\r , awakened; and being, happily for himself, an absent old gentleman,\\r , buried them again in the pages of the musty book.\\r , \\r , He was roused by a touch on the shoulder, and a request from the man\\r , with the keys to follow him into the office.  He closed his book\\r , hastily; and was at once ushered into the imposing presence of the\\r , renowned Mr. Fang.\\r , \\r , The office was a front parlour, with a panelled wall.  Mr. Fang sat\\r , behind a bar, at the upper end; and on one side the door was a sort of\\r , wooden pen in which poor little Oliver was already deposited; trembling\\r , very much at the awfulness of the scene.\\r , \\r , Mr. Fang was a lean, long-backed, stiff-necked, middle-sized man, with\\r , no great quantity of hair, and what he had, growing on the back and\\r , sides of his head.  His face was stern, and much flushed.  If he were\\r , really not in the habit of drinking rather more than was exactly good\\r , for him, he might have brought action against his countenance for\\r , libel, and have recovered heavy damages.\\r , \\r , The old gentleman bowed respectfully; and advancing to the magistrate\\'s\\r , desk, said, suiting the action to the word, \\'That is my name and\\r , address, sir.\\'  He then withdrew a pace or two; and, with another\\r , polite and gentlemanly inclination of the head, waited to be questioned.\\r , \\r , Now, it so happened that Mr. Fang was at that moment perusing a leading\\r , article in a newspaper of the morning, adverting to some recent\\r , decision of his, and commending him, for the three hundred and fiftieth\\r , time, to the special and particular notice of the Secretary of State\\r , for the Home Department.  He was out of temper; and he looked up with\\r , an angry scowl.\\r , \\r , \\'Who are you?\\' said Mr. Fang.\\r , \\r , The old gentleman pointed, with some surprise, to his card.\\r , \\r , \\'Officer!\\' said Mr. Fang, tossing the card contemptuously away with the\\r , newspaper.  \\'Who is this fellow?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'My name, sir,\\' said the old gentleman, speaking _like_ a gentleman,\\r , \\'my name, sir, is Brownlow.  Permit me to inquire the name of the\\r , magistrate who offers a gratuitous and unprovoked insult to a\\r , respectable person, under the protection of the bench.\\'  Saying this,\\r , Mr. Brownlow looked around the office as if in search of some person\\r , who would afford him the required information.\\r , \\r , \\'Officer!\\' said Mr. Fang, throwing the paper on one side, \\'what\\'s this\\r , fellow charged with?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He\\'s not charged at all, your worship,\\' replied the officer. \\'He\\r , appears against this boy, your worship.\\'\\r , \\r , His worship knew this perfectly well; but it was a good annoyance, and\\r , a safe one.\\r , \\r , \\'Appears against the boy, does he?\\' said Mr. Fang, surveying Mr.\\r , Brownlow contemptuously from head to foot.  \\'Swear him!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Before I am sworn, I must beg to say one word,\\' said Mr. Brownlow;\\r , \\'and that is, that I really never, without actual experience, could\\r , have believed--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hold your tongue, sir!\\' said Mr. Fang, peremptorily.\\r , \\r , \\'I will not, sir!\\' replied the old gentleman.\\r , \\r , \\'Hold your tongue this instant, or I\\'ll have you turned out of the\\r , office!\\' said Mr. Fang.  \\'You\\'re an insolent impertinent fellow.  How\\r , dare you bully a magistrate!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What!\\' exclaimed the old gentleman, reddening.\\r , \\r , \\'Swear this person!\\' said Fang to the clerk.  \\'I\\'ll not hear another\\r , word.  Swear him.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Brownlow\\'s indignation was greatly roused; but reflecting perhaps,\\r , that he might only injure the boy by giving vent to it, he suppressed\\r , his feelings and submitted to be sworn at once.\\r , \\r , \\'Now,\\' said Fang, \\'what\\'s the charge against this boy?  What have you\\r , got to say, sir?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I was standing at a bookstall--\\' Mr. Brownlow began.\\r , \\r , \\'Hold your tongue, sir,\\' said Mr. Fang.  \\'Policeman!  Where\\'s the\\r , policeman?  Here, swear this policeman.  Now, policeman, what is this?\\'\\r , \\r , The policeman, with becoming humility, related how he had taken the\\r , charge; how he had searched Oliver, and found nothing on his person;\\r , and how that was all he knew about it.\\r , \\r , \\'Are there any witnesses?\\' inquired Mr. Fang.\\r , \\r , \\'None, your worship,\\' replied the policeman.\\r , \\r , Mr. Fang sat silent for some minutes, and then, turning round to the\\r , prosecutor, said in a towering passion.\\r , \\r , \\'Do you mean to state what your complaint against this boy is, man, or\\r , do you not?  You have been sworn.  Now, if you stand there, refusing to\\r , give evidence, I\\'ll punish you for disrespect to the bench; I will,\\r , by--\\'\\r , \\r , By what, or by whom, nobody knows, for the clerk and jailor coughed\\r , very loud, just at the right moment; and the former dropped a heavy\\r , book upon the floor, thus preventing the word from being\\r , heard--accidently, of course.\\r , \\r , With many interruptions, and repeated insults, Mr. Brownlow contrived\\r , to state his case;  observing that, in the surprise of the moment, he\\r , had run after the boy because he had saw him running away; and\\r , expressing his hope that, if the magistrate should believe him,\\r , although not actually the thief, to be connected with the thieves, he\\r , would deal as leniently with him as justice would allow.\\r , \\r , \\'He has been hurt already,\\' said the old gentleman in conclusion. \\'And\\r , I fear,\\' he added, with great energy, looking towards the bar, \\'I\\r , really fear that he is ill.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh! yes, I dare say!\\' said Mr. Fang, with a sneer.  \\'Come, none of\\r , your tricks here, you young vagabond; they won\\'t do. What\\'s your name?\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver tried to reply but his tongue failed him.  He was deadly pale;\\r , and the whole place seemed turning round and round.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s your name, you hardened scoundrel?\\' demanded Mr. Fang.\\r , \\'Officer, what\\'s his name?\\'\\r , \\r , This was addressed to a bluff old fellow, in a striped waistcoat, who\\r , was standing by the bar.  He bent over Oliver, and repeated the\\r , inquiry; but finding him really incapable of understanding the\\r , question; and knowing that his not replying would only infuriate the\\r , magistrate the more, and add to the severity of his sentence; he\\r , hazarded a guess.\\r , \\r , \\'He says his name\\'s Tom White, your worship,\\' said the kind-hearted\\r , thief-taker.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, he won\\'t speak out, won\\'t he?\\' said Fang.  \\'Very well, very well.\\r , Where does he live?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Where he can, your worship,\\' replied the officer; again pretending to\\r , receive Oliver\\'s answer.\\r , \\r , \\'Has he any parents?\\' inquired Mr. Fang.\\r , \\r , \\'He says they died in his infancy, your worship,\\' replied the officer:\\r , hazarding the usual reply.\\r , \\r , At this point of the inquiry, Oliver raised his head; and, looking\\r , round with imploring eyes, murmured a feeble prayer for a draught of\\r , water.\\r , \\r , \\'Stuff and nonsense!\\' said Mr. Fang:  \\'don\\'t try to make a fool of me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I think he really is ill, your worship,\\' remonstrated the officer.\\r , \\r , \\'I know better,\\' said Mr. Fang.\\r , \\r , \\'Take care of him, officer,\\' said the old gentleman, raising his hands\\r , instinctively; \\'he\\'ll fall down.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Stand away, officer,\\' cried Fang;  \\'let him, if he likes.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver availed himself of the kind permission, and fell to the floor in\\r , a fainting fit.  The men in the office looked at each other, but no one\\r , dared to stir.\\r , \\r , \\'I knew he was shamming,\\' said Fang, as if this were incontestable\\r , proof of the fact.  \\'Let him lie there; he\\'ll soon be tired of that.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'How do you propose to deal with the case, sir?\\'  inquired the clerk in\\r , a low voice.\\r , \\r , \\'Summarily,\\' replied Mr. Fang.  \\'He stands committed for three\\r , months--hard labour of course.  Clear the office.\\'\\r , \\r , The door was opened for this purpose, and a couple of men were\\r , preparing to carry the insensible boy to his cell; when an elderly man\\r , of decent but poor appearance, clad in an old suit of black, rushed\\r , hastily into the office, and advanced towards the bench.\\r , \\r , \\'Stop, stop!  don\\'t take him away!  For Heaven\\'s sake stop a moment!\\'\\r , cried the new comer, breathless with haste.\\r , \\r , Although the presiding Genii in such an office as this, exercise a\\r , summary and arbitrary power over the liberties, the good name, the\\r , character, almost the lives, of Her Majesty\\'s subjects, expecially of\\r , the poorer class; and although, within such walls, enough fantastic\\r , tricks are daily played to make the angels blind with weeping; they are\\r , closed to the public, save through the medium of the daily\\r , press.[Footnote:  Or were virtually, then.] Mr. Fang was consequently\\r , not a little indignant to see an unbidden guest enter in such\\r , irreverent disorder.\\r , \\r , \\'What is this?  Who is this?  Turn this man out.  Clear the office!\\'\\r , cried Mr. Fang.\\r , \\r , \\'I _will_ speak,\\' cried the man; \\'I will not be turned out.  I saw it\\r , all.  I keep the book-stall.  I demand to be sworn. I will not be put\\r , down.  Mr. Fang, you must hear me.  You must not refuse, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , The man was right.  His manner was determined; and the matter was\\r , growing rather too serious to be hushed up.\\r , \\r , \\'Swear the man,\\' growled Mr. Fang, with a very ill grace. \\'Now, man,\\r , what have you got to say?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'This,\\' said the man:  \\'I saw three boys:  two others and the prisoner\\r , here:  loitering on the opposite side of the way, when this gentleman\\r , was reading.  The robbery was committed by another boy.  I saw it done;\\r , and I saw that this boy was perfectly amazed and stupified by it.\\'\\r , Having by this time recovered a little breath, the worthy book-stall\\r , keeper proceeded to relate, in a more coherent manner the exact\\r , circumstances of the robbery.\\r , \\r , \\'Why didn\\'t you come here before?\\' said Fang, after a pause.\\r , \\r , \\'I hadn\\'t a soul to mind the shop,\\' replied the man.  \\'Everybody who\\r , could have helped me, had joined in the pursuit.  I could get nobody\\r , till five minutes ago; and I\\'ve run here all the way.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The prosecutor was reading, was he?\\' inquired Fang, after another\\r , pause.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' replied the man.  \\'The very book he has in his hand.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, that book, eh?\\' said Fang.  \\'Is it paid for?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, it is not,\\' replied the man, with a smile.\\r , \\r , \\'Dear me, I forgot all about it!\\' exclaimed the absent old gentleman,\\r , innocently.\\r , \\r , \\'A nice person to prefer a charge against a poor boy!\\' said Fang, with\\r , a comical effort to look humane.  \\'I consider, sir, that you have\\r , obtained possession of that book, under very suspicious and\\r , disreputable circumstances; and you may think yourself very fortunate\\r , that the owner of the property declines to prosecute. Let this be a\\r , lesson to you, my man, or the law will overtake you yet.  The boy is\\r , discharged.  Clear the office!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'D--n me!\\' cried the old gentleman, bursting out with the rage he had\\r , kept down so long, \\'d--n me!   I\\'ll--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Clear the office!\\' said the magistrate.  \\'Officers, do you hear? Clear\\r , the office!\\'\\r , \\r , The mandate was obeyed; and the indignant Mr. Brownlow was conveyed\\r , out, with the book in one hand, and the bamboo cane in the other:  in a\\r , perfect phrenzy of rage and defiance.  He reached the yard; and his\\r , passion vanished in a moment.  Little Oliver Twist lay on his back on\\r , the pavement, with his shirt unbuttoned, and his temples bathed with\\r , water; his face a deadly white; and a cold tremble convulsing his whole\\r , frame.\\r , \\r , \\'Poor boy, poor boy!\\' said Mr. Brownlow, bending over him. \\'Call a\\r , coach, somebody, pray.  Directly!\\'\\r , \\r , A coach was obtained, and Oliver having been carefully laid on the\\r , seat, the old gentleman got in and sat himself on the other.\\r , \\r , \\'May I accompany you?\\' said the book-stall keeper, looking in.\\r , \\r , \\'Bless me, yes, my dear sir,\\' said Mr. Brownlow quickly.  \\'I forgot\\r , you.  Dear, dear!  I have this unhappy book still! Jump in.  Poor\\r , fellow!  There\\'s no time to lose.\\'\\r , \\r , The book-stall keeper got into the coach; and away they drove.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XII\\r , \\r , IN WHICH OLIVER IS TAKEN BETTER CARE OF THAN HE EVER WAS BEFORE. AND IN\\r , WHICH THE NARRATIVE REVERTS TO THE MERRY OLD GENTLEMAN AND HIS YOUTHFUL\\r , FRIENDS.\\r , \\r , The coach rattled away, over nearly the same ground as that which\\r , Oliver had traversed when he first entered London in company with the\\r , Dodger; and, turning a different way when it reached the Angel at\\r , Islington, stopped at length before a neat house, in a quiet shady\\r , street near Pentonville.  Here, a bed was prepared, without loss of\\r , time, in which Mr. Brownlow saw his young charge carefully and\\r , comfortably deposited; and here, he was tended with a kindness and\\r , solicitude that knew no bounds.\\r , \\r , But, for many days, Oliver remained insensible to all the goodness of\\r , his new friends.  The sun rose and sank, and rose and sank again, and\\r , many times after that; and still the boy lay stretched on his uneasy\\r , bed, dwindling away beneath the dry and wasting heat of fever.  The\\r , worm does not work more surely on the dead body, than does this slow\\r , creeping fire upon the living frame.\\r , \\r , Weak, and thin, and pallid, he awoke at last from what seemed to have\\r , been a long and troubled dream.  Feebly raising himself in the bed,\\r , with his head resting on his trembling arm, he looked anxiously around.\\r , \\r , \\'What room is this?  Where have I been brought to?\\' said Oliver. \\'This\\r , is not the place I went to sleep in.\\'\\r , \\r , He uttered these words in a feeble voice, being very faint and weak;\\r , but they were overheard at once.  The curtain at the bed\\'s head was\\r , hastily drawn back, and a motherly old lady, very neatly and precisely\\r , dressed, rose as she undrew it, from an arm-chair close by, in which\\r , she had been sitting at needle-work.\\r , \\r , \\'Hush, my dear,\\' said the old lady softly.  \\'You must be very quiet, or\\r , you will be ill again; and you have been very bad,--as bad as bad could\\r , be, pretty nigh.  Lie down again; there\\'s a dear!\\'  With those words,\\r , the old lady very gently placed Oliver\\'s head upon the pillow; and,\\r , smoothing back his hair from his forehead, looked so kindly and loving\\r , in his face, that he could not help placing his little withered hand in\\r , hers, and drawing it round his neck.\\r , \\r , \\'Save us!\\' said the old lady, with tears in her eyes.  \\'What a grateful\\r , little dear it is.  Pretty creetur!  What would his mother feel if she\\r , had sat by him as I have, and could see him now!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Perhaps she does see me,\\' whispered Oliver, folding his hands\\r , together; \\'perhaps she has sat by me.  I almost feel as if she had.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That was the fever, my dear,\\' said the old lady mildly.\\r , \\r , \\'I suppose it was,\\' replied Oliver, \\'because heaven is a long way off;\\r , and they are too happy there, to come down to the bedside of a poor\\r , boy.  But if she knew I was ill, she must have pitied me, even there;\\r , for she was very ill herself before she died.  She can\\'t know anything\\r , about me though,\\' added Oliver after a moment\\'s silence.  \\'If she had\\r , seen me hurt, it would have made her sorrowful; and her face has always\\r , looked sweet and happy, when I have dreamed of her.\\'\\r , \\r , The old lady made no reply to this; but wiping her eyes first, and her\\r , spectacles, which lay on the counterpane, afterwards, as if they were\\r , part and parcel of those features, brought some cool stuff for Oliver\\r , to drink; and then, patting him on the cheek, told him he must lie very\\r , quiet, or he would be ill again.\\r , \\r , So, Oliver kept very still; partly because he was anxious to obey the\\r , kind old lady in all things; and partly, to tell the truth, because he\\r , was completely exhausted with what he had already said.  He soon fell\\r , into a gentle doze, from which he was awakened by the light of a\\r , candle:  which, being brought near the bed, showed him a gentleman with\\r , a very large and loud-ticking gold watch in his hand, who felt his\\r , pulse, and said he was a great deal better.\\r , \\r , \\'You _are_ a great deal better, are you not, my dear?\\' said the\\r , gentleman.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, thank you, sir,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,  I know you are,\\' said the gentleman:  \\'You\\'re hungry too, an\\'t\\r , you?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, sir,\\' answered Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Hem!\\' said the gentleman.  \\'No, I know you\\'re not.  He is not hungry,\\r , Mrs. Bedwin,\\' said the gentleman:  looking very wise.\\r , \\r , The old lady made a respectful inclination of the head, which seemed to\\r , say that she thought the doctor was a very clever man. The doctor\\r , appeared much of the same opinion himself.\\r , \\r , \\'You feel sleepy, don\\'t you, my dear?\\' said the doctor.\\r , \\r , \\'No, sir,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' said the doctor, with a very shrewd and satisfied look. \\'You\\'re\\r , not sleepy.  Nor thirsty.  Are you?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, sir, rather thirsty,\\' answered Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Just as I expected, Mrs. Bedwin,\\' said the doctor.  \\'It\\'s very natural\\r , that he should be thirsty.  You may give him a little tea, ma\\'am, and\\r , some dry toast without any butter.  Don\\'t keep him too warm, ma\\'am; but\\r , be careful that you don\\'t let him be too cold; will you have the\\r , goodness?\\'\\r , \\r , The old lady dropped a curtsey.  The doctor, after tasting the cool\\r , stuff, and expressing a qualified approval of it, hurried away:  his\\r , boots creaking in a very important and wealthy manner as he went\\r , downstairs.\\r , \\r , Oliver dozed off again, soon after this; when he awoke, it was nearly\\r , twelve o\\'clock.  The old lady tenderly bade him good-night shortly\\r , afterwards, and left him in charge of a fat old woman who had just\\r , come:  bringing with her, in a little bundle, a small Prayer Book and a\\r , large nightcap. Putting the latter on her head and the former on the\\r , table, the old woman, after telling Oliver that she had come to sit up\\r , with him, drew her chair close to the fire and went off into a series\\r , of short naps, chequered at frequent intervals with sundry tumblings\\r , forward, and divers moans and chokings. These, however, had no worse\\r , effect than causing her to rub her nose very hard, and then fall asleep\\r , again.\\r , \\r , And thus the night crept slowly on.  Oliver lay awake for some time,\\r , counting the little circles of light which the reflection of the\\r , rushlight-shade threw upon the ceiling; or tracing with his languid\\r , eyes the intricate pattern of the paper on the wall. The darkness and\\r , the deep stillness of the room were very solemn; as they brought into\\r , the boy\\'s mind the thought that death had been hovering there, for many\\r , days and nights, and might yet fill it with the gloom and dread of his\\r , awful presence, he turned his face upon the pillow, and fervently\\r , prayed to Heaven.\\r , \\r , Gradually, he fell into that deep tranquil sleep which ease from recent\\r , suffering alone imparts; that calm and peaceful rest which it is pain\\r , to wake from.  Who, if this were death, would be roused again to all\\r , the struggles and turmoils of life; to all its cares for the present;\\r , its anxieties for the future; more than all, its weary recollections of\\r , the past!\\r , \\r , It had been bright day, for hours, when Oliver opened his eyes; he felt\\r , cheerful and happy.  The crisis of the disease was safely past.  He\\r , belonged to the world again.\\r , \\r , In three days\\' time he was able to sit in an easy-chair, well propped\\r , up with pillows; and, as he was still too weak to walk, Mrs. Bedwin had\\r , him carried downstairs into the little housekeeper\\'s room, which\\r , belonged to her.  Having him set, here, by the fire-side, the good old\\r , lady sat herself down too; and, being in a state of considerable\\r , delight at seeing him so much better, forthwith began to cry most\\r , violently.\\r , \\r , \\'Never mind me, my dear,\\' said the old lady; \\'I\\'m only having a regular\\r , good cry.  There; it\\'s all over now; and I\\'m quite comfortable.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'re very, very kind to me, ma\\'am,\\' said Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, never you mind that, my dear,\\' said the old lady; \\'that\\'s got\\r , nothing to do with your broth; and it\\'s full time you had it; for the\\r , doctor says Mr. Brownlow may come in to see you this morning; and we\\r , must get up our best looks, because the better we look, the more he\\'ll\\r , be pleased.\\'  And with this, the old lady applied herself to warming\\r , up, in a little saucepan, a basin full of broth:  strong enough, Oliver\\r , thought, to furnish an ample dinner, when reduced to the regulation\\r , strength, for three hundred and fifty paupers, at the lowest\\r , computation.\\r , \\r , \\'Are you fond of pictures, dear?\\' inquired the old lady, seeing that\\r , Oliver had fixed his eyes, most intently, on a portrait which hung\\r , against the wall; just opposite his chair.\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t quite know, ma\\'am,\\' said Oliver, without taking his eyes from\\r , the canvas; \\'I have seen so few that I hardly know.  What a beautiful,\\r , mild face that lady\\'s is!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!\\' said the old lady, \\'painters always make ladies out prettier than\\r , they are, or they wouldn\\'t get any custom, child. The man that invented\\r , the machine for taking likenesses might have known that would never\\r , succeed; it\\'s a deal too honest.  A deal,\\' said the old lady, laughing\\r , very heartily at her own acuteness.\\r , \\r , \\'Is--is that a likeness, ma\\'am?\\' said Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' said the old lady, looking up for a moment from the broth;\\r , \\'that\\'s a portrait.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Whose, ma\\'am?\\' asked Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, really, my dear, I don\\'t know,\\' answered the old lady in a\\r , good-humoured manner.  \\'It\\'s not a likeness of anybody that you or I\\r , know, I expect.  It seems to strike your fancy, dear.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It is so pretty,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, sure you\\'re not afraid of it?\\' said the old lady: observing in\\r , great surprise, the look of awe with which the child regarded the\\r , painting.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh no, no,\\' returned Oliver quickly; \\'but the eyes look so sorrowful;\\r , and where I sit, they seem fixed upon me.  It makes my heart beat,\\'\\r , added Oliver in a low voice, \\'as if it was alive, and wanted to speak\\r , to me, but couldn\\'t.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Lord save us!\\' exclaimed the old lady, starting; \\'don\\'t talk in that\\r , way, child.  You\\'re weak and nervous after your illness. Let me wheel\\r , your chair round to the other side; and then you won\\'t see it.  There!\\'\\r , said the old lady, suiting the action to the word; \\'you don\\'t see it\\r , now, at all events.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver _did_ see it in his mind\\'s eye as distinctly as if he had not\\r , altered his position; but he thought it better not to worry the kind\\r , old lady; so he smiled gently when she looked at him; and Mrs. Bedwin,\\r , satisfied that he felt more comfortable, salted and broke bits of\\r , toasted bread into the broth, with all the bustle befitting so solemn a\\r , preparation. Oliver got through it with extraordinary expedition.  He\\r , had scarcely swallowed the last spoonful, when there came a soft rap at\\r , the door.  \\'Come in,\\' said the old lady; and in walked Mr. Brownlow.\\r , \\r , Now, the old gentleman came in as brisk as need be; but, he had no\\r , sooner raised his spectacles on his forehead, and thrust his hands\\r , behind the skirts of his dressing-gown to take a good long look at\\r , Oliver, than his countenance underwent a very great variety of odd\\r , contortions.  Oliver looked very worn and shadowy from sickness, and\\r , made an ineffectual attempt to stand up, out of respect to his\\r , benefactor, which terminated in his sinking back into the chair again;\\r , and the fact is, if the truth must be told, that Mr. Brownlow\\'s heart,\\r , being large enough for any six ordinary old gentlemen of humane\\r , disposition, forced a supply of tears into his eyes, by some hydraulic\\r , process which we are not sufficiently philosophical to be in a\\r , condition to explain.\\r , \\r , \\'Poor boy, poor boy!\\' said Mr. Brownlow, clearing his throat. \\'I\\'m\\r , rather hoarse this morning, Mrs. Bedwin.  I\\'m afraid I have caught\\r , cold.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I hope not, sir,\\' said Mrs. Bedwin.  \\'Everything you have had, has\\r , been well aired, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t know, Bedwin.  I don\\'t know,\\' said Mr. Brownlow; \\'I rather\\r , think I had a damp napkin at dinner-time yesterday; but never mind\\r , that.  How do you feel, my dear?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Very happy, sir,\\' replied Oliver.  \\'And very grateful indeed, sir, for\\r , your goodness to me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Good by,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, stoutly.  \\'Have you given him any\\r , nourishment, Bedwin?  Any slops, eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He has just had a basin of beautiful strong broth, sir,\\' replied Mrs.\\r , Bedwin:  drawing herself up slightly, and laying strong emphasis on the\\r , last word:  to intimate that between slops, and broth will compounded,\\r , there existed no affinity or connection whatsoever.\\r , \\r , \\'Ugh!\\' said Mr. Brownlow, with a slight shudder; \\'a couple of glasses\\r , of port wine would have done him a great deal more good. Wouldn\\'t they,\\r , Tom White, eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'My name is Oliver, sir,\\' replied the little invalid:  with a look of\\r , great astonishment.\\r , \\r , \\'Oliver,\\' said Mr. Brownlow; \\'Oliver what?  Oliver White, eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, sir, Twist, Oliver Twist.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Queer name!\\' said the old gentleman.  \\'What made you tell the\\r , magistrate your name was White?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I never told him so, sir,\\' returned Oliver in amazement.\\r , \\r , This sounded so like a falsehood, that the old gentleman looked\\r , somewhat sternly in Oliver\\'s face.  It was impossible to doubt him;\\r , there was truth in every one of its thin and sharpened lineaments.\\r , \\r , \\'Some mistake,\\' said Mr. Brownlow.  But, although his motive for\\r , looking steadily at Oliver no longer existed, the old idea of the\\r , resemblance between his features and some familiar face came upon him\\r , so strongly, that he could not withdraw his gaze.\\r , \\r , \\'I hope you are not angry with me, sir?\\' said Oliver, raising his eyes\\r , beseechingly.\\r , \\r , \\'No, no,\\' replied the old gentleman.  \\'Why! what\\'s this?  Bedwin, look\\r , there!\\'\\r , \\r , As he spoke, he pointed hastily to the picture over Oliver\\'s head, and\\r , then to the boy\\'s face.  There was its living copy. The eyes, the head,\\r , the mouth; every feature was the same. The expression was, for the\\r , instant, so precisely alike, that the minutest line seemed copied with\\r , startling accuracy!\\r , \\r , Oliver knew not the cause of this sudden exclamation; for, not being\\r , strong enough to bear the start it gave him, he fainted away.  A\\r , weakness on his part, which affords the narrative an opportunity of\\r , relieving the reader from suspense, in behalf of the two young pupils\\r , of the Merry Old Gentleman; and of recording--\\r , \\r , That when the Dodger, and his accomplished friend Master Bates, joined\\r , in the hue-and-cry which was raised at Oliver\\'s heels, in consequence\\r , of their executing an illegal conveyance of Mr. Brownlow\\'s personal\\r , property, as has been already described, they were actuated by a very\\r , laudable and becoming regard for themselves; and forasmuch as the\\r , freedom of the subject and the liberty of the individual are among the\\r , first and proudest boasts of a true-hearted Englishman, so, I need\\r , hardly beg the reader to observe, that this action should tend to exalt\\r , them in the opinion of all public and patriotic men, in almost as great\\r , a degree as this strong proof of their anxiety for their own\\r , preservation and safety goes to corroborate and confirm the little code\\r , of laws which certain profound and sound-judging philosophers have laid\\r , down as the main-springs of all Nature\\'s deeds and actions:  the said\\r , philosophers very wisely reducing the good lady\\'s proceedings to\\r , matters of maxim and theory:  and, by a very neat and pretty compliment\\r , to her exalted wisdom and understanding, putting entirely out of sight\\r , any considerations of heart, or generous impulse and feeling. For,\\r , these are matters totally beneath a female who is acknowledged by\\r , universal admission to be far above the numerous little foibles and\\r , weaknesses of her sex.\\r , \\r , If I wanted any further proof of the strictly philosophical nature of\\r , the conduct of these young gentlemen in their very delicate\\r , predicament, I should at once find it in the fact (also recorded in a\\r , foregoing part of this narrative), of their quitting the pursuit, when\\r , the general attention was fixed upon Oliver; and making immediately for\\r , their home by the shortest possible cut.  Although I do not mean to\\r , assert that it is usually the practice of renowned and learned sages,\\r , to shorten the road to any great conclusion (their course indeed being\\r , rather to lengthen the distance, by various circumlocutions and\\r , discursive staggerings, like unto those in which drunken men under the\\r , pressure of a too mighty flow of ideas, are prone to indulge); still, I\\r , do mean to say, and do say distinctly, that it is the invariable\\r , practice of many mighty philosophers, in carrying out their theories,\\r , to evince great wisdom and foresight in providing against every\\r , possible contingency which can be supposed at all likely to affect\\r , themselves.  Thus, to do a great right, you may do a little wrong; and\\r , you may take any means which the end to be attained, will justify; the\\r , amount of the right, or the amount of the wrong, or indeed the\\r , distinction between the two, being left entirely to the philosopher\\r , concerned, to be settled and determined by his clear, comprehensive,\\r , and impartial view of his own particular case.\\r , \\r , It was not until the two boys had scoured, with great rapidity, through\\r , a most intricate maze of narrow streets and courts, that they ventured\\r , to halt beneath a low and dark archway.  Having remained silent here,\\r , just long enough to recover breath to speak, Master Bates uttered an\\r , exclamation of amusement and delight; and, bursting into an\\r , uncontrollable fit of laughter, flung himself upon a doorstep, and\\r , rolled thereon in a transport of mirth.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s the matter?\\' inquired the Dodger.\\r , \\r , \\'Ha! ha! ha!\\' roared Charley Bates.\\r , \\r , \\'Hold your noise,\\' remonstrated the Dodger, looking cautiously round.\\r , \\'Do you want to be grabbed, stupid?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I can\\'t help it,\\' said Charley, \\'I can\\'t help it!  To see him\\r , splitting away at that pace, and cutting round the corners, and\\r , knocking up again\\' the posts, and starting on again as if he was made\\r , of iron as well as them, and me with the wipe in my pocket, singing out\\r , arter him--oh, my eye!\\' The vivid imagination of Master Bates presented\\r , the scene before him in too strong colours.  As he arrived at this\\r , apostrophe, he again rolled upon the door-step, and laughed louder than\\r , before.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'ll Fagin say?\\' inquired the Dodger; taking advantage of the next\\r , interval of breathlessness on the part of his friend to propound the\\r , question.\\r , \\r , \\'What?\\' repeated Charley Bates.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah, what?\\' said the Dodger.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, what should he say?\\' inquired Charley:  stopping rather suddenly\\r , in his merriment; for the Dodger\\'s manner was impressive.  \\'What should\\r , he say?\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Dawkins whistled for a couple of minutes; then, taking off his hat,\\r , scratched his head, and nodded thrice.\\r , \\r , \\'What do you mean?\\' said Charley.\\r , \\r , \\'Toor rul lol loo, gammon and spinnage, the frog he wouldn\\'t, and high\\r , cockolorum,\\' said the Dodger:  with a slight sneer on his intellectual\\r , countenance.\\r , \\r , This was explanatory, but not satisfactory.  Master Bates felt it so;\\r , and again said, \\'What do you mean?\\'\\r , \\r , The Dodger made no reply; but putting his hat on again, and gathering\\r , the skirts of his long-tailed coat under his arm, thrust his tongue\\r , into his cheek, slapped the bridge of his nose some half-dozen times in\\r , a familiar but expressive manner, and turning on his heel, slunk down\\r , the court.  Master Bates followed, with a thoughtful countenance.\\r , \\r , The noise of footsteps on the creaking stairs, a few minutes after the\\r , occurrence of this conversation, roused the merry old gentleman as he\\r , sat over the fire with a saveloy and a small loaf in his hand; a\\r , pocket-knife in his right; and a pewter pot on the trivet.  There was a\\r , rascally smile on his white face as he turned round, and looking\\r , sharply out from under his thick red eyebrows, bent his ear towards the\\r , door, and listened.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, how\\'s this?\\' muttered the Jew:  changing countenance; \\'only two\\r , of \\'em?  Where\\'s the third?  They can\\'t have got into trouble.  Hark!\\'\\r , \\r , The footsteps approached nearer; they reached the landing. The door was\\r , slowly opened; and the Dodger and Charley Bates entered, closing it\\r , behind them.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XIII\\r , \\r , SOME NEW ACQUAINTANCES ARE INTRODUCED TO THE INTELLIGENT READER,\\r , CONNECTED WITH WHOM VARIOUS PLEASANT MATTERS ARE RELATED, APPERTAINING\\r , TO THIS HISTORY\\r , \\r , \\'Where\\'s Oliver?\\' said the Jew, rising with a menacing look. \\'Where\\'s\\r , the boy?\\'\\r , \\r , The young thieves eyed their preceptor as if they were alarmed at his\\r , violence; and looked uneasily at each other.  But they made no reply.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s become of the boy?\\' said the Jew, seizing the Dodger tightly by\\r , the collar, and threatening him with horrid imprecations.  \\'Speak out,\\r , or I\\'ll throttle you!\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Fagin looked so very much in earnest, that Charley Bates, who\\r , deemed it prudent in all cases to be on the safe side, and who\\r , conceived it by no means improbable that it might be his turn to be\\r , throttled second, dropped upon his knees, and raised a loud,\\r , well-sustained, and continuous roar--something between a mad bull and a\\r , speaking trumpet.\\r , \\r , \\'Will you speak?\\' thundered the Jew:  shaking the Dodger so much that\\r , his keeping in the big coat at all, seemed perfectly miraculous.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, the traps have got him, and that\\'s all about it,\\' said the\\r , Dodger, sullenly.  \\'Come, let go o\\' me, will you!\\'  And, swinging\\r , himself, at one jerk, clean out of the big coat, which he left in the\\r , Jew\\'s hands, the Dodger snatched up the toasting fork, and made a pass\\r , at the merry old gentleman\\'s waistcoat; which, if it had taken effect,\\r , would have let a little more merriment out than could have been easily\\r , replaced.\\r , \\r , The Jew stepped back in this emergency, with more agility than could\\r , have been anticipated in a man of his apparent decrepitude; and,\\r , seizing up the pot, prepared to hurl it at his assailant\\'s head.  But\\r , Charley Bates, at this moment, calling his attention by a perfectly\\r , terrific howl, he suddenly altered its destination, and flung it full\\r , at that young gentleman.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, what the blazes is in the wind now!\\' growled a deep voice. \\'Who\\r , pitched that \\'ere at me?  It\\'s well it\\'s the beer, and not the pot, as\\r , hit me, or I\\'d have settled somebody.  I might have know\\'d, as nobody\\r , but an infernal, rich, plundering, thundering old Jew could afford to\\r , throw away any drink but water--and not that, unless he done the River\\r , Company every quarter.  Wot\\'s it all about, Fagin?  D--me, if my\\r , neck-handkercher an\\'t lined with beer!  Come in, you sneaking warmint;\\r , wot are you stopping outside for, as if you was ashamed of your master!\\r , Come in!\\'\\r , \\r , The man who growled out these words, was a stoutly-built fellow of\\r , about five-and-thirty, in a black velveteen coat, very soiled drab\\r , breeches, lace-up half boots, and grey cotton stockings which inclosed\\r , a bulky pair of legs, with large swelling calves;--the kind of legs,\\r , which in such costume, always look in an unfinished and incomplete\\r , state without a set of fetters to garnish them.  He had a brown hat on\\r , his head, and a dirty belcher handkerchief round his neck:  with the\\r , long frayed ends of which he smeared the beer from his face as he\\r , spoke.  He disclosed, when he had done so, a broad heavy countenance\\r , with a beard of three days\\' growth, and two scowling eyes; one of which\\r , displayed various parti-coloured symptoms of having been recently\\r , damaged by a blow.\\r , \\r , \\'Come in, d\\'ye hear?\\' growled this engaging ruffian.\\r , \\r , A white shaggy dog, with his face scratched and torn in twenty\\r , different places, skulked into the room.\\r , \\r , \\'Why didn\\'t you come in afore?\\' said the man.  \\'You\\'re getting too\\r , proud to own me afore company, are you?  Lie down!\\'\\r , \\r , This command was accompanied with a kick, which sent the animal to the\\r , other end of the room.  He appeared well used to it, however; for he\\r , coiled himself up in a corner very quietly, without uttering a sound,\\r , and winking his very ill-looking eyes twenty times in a minute,\\r , appeared to occupy himself in taking a survey of the apartment.\\r , \\r , \\'What are you up to?  Ill-treating the boys, you covetous, avaricious,\\r , in-sa-ti-a-ble old fence?\\' said the man, seating himself deliberately.\\r , \\'I wonder they don\\'t murder you!  I would if I was them.  If I\\'d been\\r , your \\'prentice, I\\'d have done it long ago, and--no, I couldn\\'t have\\r , sold you afterwards, for you\\'re fit for nothing but keeping as a\\r , curiousity of ugliness in a glass bottle, and I suppose they don\\'t blow\\r , glass bottles large enough.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hush! hush! Mr. Sikes,\\' said the Jew, trembling; \\'don\\'t speak so loud!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'None of your mistering,\\' replied the ruffian; \\'you always mean\\r , mischief when you come that.  You know my name:  out with it!  I shan\\'t\\r , disgrace it when the time comes.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, well, then--Bill Sikes,\\' said the Jew, with abject humility.\\r , \\'You seem out of humour, Bill.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Perhaps I am,\\' replied Sikes; \\'I should think you was rather out of\\r , sorts too, unless you mean as little harm when you throw pewter pots\\r , about, as you do when you blab and--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Are you mad?\\' said the Jew, catching the man by the sleeve, and\\r , pointing towards the boys.\\r , \\r , Mr. Sikes contented himself with tying an imaginary knot under his left\\r , ear, and jerking his head over on the right shoulder; a piece of dumb\\r , show which the Jew appeared to understand perfectly.  He then, in cant\\r , terms, with which his whole conversation was plentifully besprinkled,\\r , but which would be quite unintelligible if they were recorded here,\\r , demanded a glass of liquor.\\r , \\r , \\'And mind you don\\'t poison it,\\' said Mr. Sikes, laying his hat upon the\\r , table.\\r , \\r , This was said in jest; but if the speaker could have seen the evil leer\\r , with which the Jew bit his pale lip as he turned round to the cupboard,\\r , he might have thought the caution not wholly unnecessary, or the wish\\r , (at all events) to improve upon the distiller\\'s ingenuity not very far\\r , from the old gentleman\\'s merry heart.\\r , \\r , After swallowing two of three glasses of spirits, Mr. Sikes\\r , condescended to take some notice of the young gentlemen; which gracious\\r , act led to a conversation, in which the cause and manner of Oliver\\'s\\r , capture were circumstantially detailed, with such alterations and\\r , improvements on the truth, as to the Dodger appeared most advisable\\r , under the circumstances.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'m afraid,\\' said the Jew, \\'that he may say something which will get\\r , us into trouble.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s very likely,\\' returned Sikes with a malicious grin. \\'You\\'re\\r , blowed upon, Fagin.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And I\\'m afraid, you see,\\' added the Jew, speaking as if he had not\\r , noticed the interruption; and regarding the other closely as he did\\r , so,--\\'I\\'m afraid that, if the game was up with us, it might be up with\\r , a good many more, and that it would come out rather worse for you than\\r , it would for me, my dear.\\'\\r , \\r , The man started, and turned round upon the Jew.  But the old\\r , gentleman\\'s shoulders were shrugged up to his ears; and his eyes were\\r , vacantly staring on the opposite wall.\\r , \\r , There was a long pause. Every member of the respectable coterie\\r , appeared plunged in his own reflections; not excepting the dog, who by\\r , a certain malicious licking of his lips seemed to be meditating an\\r , attack upon the legs of the first gentleman or lady he might encounter\\r , in the streets when he went out.\\r , \\r , \\'Somebody must find out wot\\'s been done at the office,\\' said Mr. Sikes\\r , in a much lower tone than he had taken since he came in.\\r , \\r , The Jew nodded assent.\\r , \\r , \\'If he hasn\\'t peached, and is committed, there\\'s no fear till he comes\\r , out again,\\' said Mr. Sikes, \\'and then he must be taken care on.  You\\r , must get hold of him somehow.\\'\\r , \\r , Again the Jew nodded.\\r , \\r , The prudence of this line of action, indeed, was obvious; but,\\r , unfortunately, there was one very strong objection to its being\\r , adopted.  This was, that the Dodger, and Charley Bates, and Fagin, and\\r , Mr. William Sikes, happened, one and all, to entertain a violent and\\r , deeply-rooted antipathy to going near a police-office on any ground or\\r , pretext whatever.\\r , \\r , How long they might have sat and looked at each other, in a state of\\r , uncertainty not the most pleasant of its kind, it is difficult to\\r , guess.  It is not necessary to make any guesses on the subject,\\r , however; for the sudden entrance of the two young ladies whom Oliver\\r , had seen on a former occasion, caused the conversation to flow afresh.\\r , \\r , \\'The very thing!\\' said the Jew.  \\'Bet will go; won\\'t you, my dear?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Wheres?\\' inquired the young lady.\\r , \\r , \\'Only just up to the office, my dear,\\' said the Jew coaxingly.\\r , \\r , It is due to the young lady to say that she did not positively affirm\\r , that she would not, but that she merely expressed an emphatic and\\r , earnest desire to be \\'blessed\\' if she would; a polite and delicate\\r , evasion of the request, which shows the young lady to have been\\r , possessed of that natural good breeding which cannot bear to inflict\\r , upon a fellow-creature, the pain of a direct and pointed refusal.\\r , \\r , The Jew\\'s countenance fell.  He turned from this young lady, who was\\r , gaily, not to say gorgeously attired, in a red gown, green boots, and\\r , yellow curl-papers, to the other female.\\r , \\r , \\'Nancy, my dear,\\' said the Jew in a soothing manner, \\'what do YOU say?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That it won\\'t do; so it\\'s no use a-trying it on, Fagin,\\' replied Nancy.\\r , \\r , \\'What do you mean by that?\\' said Mr. Sikes, looking up in a surly\\r , manner.\\r , \\r , \\'What I say, Bill,\\' replied the lady collectedly.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, you\\'re just the very person for it,\\' reasoned Mr. Sikes: \\'nobody\\r , about here knows anything of you.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And as I don\\'t want \\'em to, neither,\\' replied Nancy in the same\\r , composed manner, \\'it\\'s rather more no than yes with me, Bill.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'She\\'ll go, Fagin,\\' said Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'No, she won\\'t, Fagin,\\' said Nancy.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, she will, Fagin,\\' said Sikes.\\r , \\r , And Mr. Sikes was right.  By dint of alternate threats, promises, and\\r , bribes, the lady in question was ultimately prevailed upon to undertake\\r , the commission.  She was not, indeed, withheld by the same\\r , considerations as her agreeable friend; for, having recently removed\\r , into the neighborhood of Field Lane from the remote but genteel suburb\\r , of Ratcliffe, she was not under the same apprehension of being\\r , recognised by any of her numerous acquaintances.\\r , \\r , Accordingly, with a clean white apron tied over her gown, and her\\r , curl-papers tucked up under a straw bonnet,--both articles of dress\\r , being provided from the Jew\\'s inexhaustible stock,--Miss Nancy prepared\\r , to issue forth on her errand.\\r , \\r , \\'Stop a minute, my dear,\\' said the Jew, producing, a little covered\\r , basket.  \\'Carry that in one hand.  It looks more respectable, my dear.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Give her a door-key to carry in her t\\'other one, Fagin,\\' said Sikes;\\r , \\'it looks real and genivine like.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, yes, my dear, so it does,\\' said the Jew, hanging a large\\r , street-door key on the forefinger of the young lady\\'s right hand.\\r , \\r , \\'There; very good!  Very good indeed, my dear!\\' said the Jew, rubbing\\r , his hands.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, my brother!  My poor, dear, sweet, innocent little brother!\\'\\r , exclaimed Nancy, bursting into tears, and wringing the little basket\\r , and the street-door key in an agony of distress.  \\'What has become of\\r , him!  Where have they taken him to!  Oh, do have pity, and tell me\\r , what\\'s been done with the dear boy, gentlemen; do, gentlemen, if you\\r , please, gentlemen!\\'\\r , \\r , Having uttered those words in a most lamentable and heart-broken tone:\\r , to the immeasurable delight of her hearers:  Miss Nancy paused, winked\\r , to the company, nodded smilingly round, and disappeared.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah, she\\'s a clever girl, my dears,\\' said the Jew, turning round to his\\r , young friends, and shaking his head gravely, as if in mute admonition\\r , to them to follow the bright example they had just beheld.\\r , \\r , \\'She\\'s a honour to her sex,\\' said Mr. Sikes, filling his glass, and\\r , smiting the table with his enormous fist.  \\'Here\\'s her health, and\\r , wishing they was all like her!\\'\\r , \\r , While these, and many other encomiums, were being passed on the\\r , accomplished Nancy, that young lady made the best of her way to the\\r , police-office; whither, notwithstanding a little natural timidity\\r , consequent upon walking through the streets alone and unprotected, she\\r , arrived in perfect safety shortly afterwards.\\r , \\r , Entering by the back way, she tapped softly with the key at one of the\\r , cell-doors, and listened.  There was no sound within:  so she coughed\\r , and listened again.  Still there was no reply:  so she spoke.\\r , \\r , \\'Nolly, dear?\\' murmured Nancy in a gentle voice; \\'Nolly?\\'\\r , \\r , There was nobody inside but a miserable shoeless criminal, who had been\\r , taken up for playing the flute, and who, the offence against society\\r , having been clearly proved, had been very properly committed by Mr.\\r , Fang to the House of Correction for one month; with the appropriate and\\r , amusing remark that since he had so much breath to spare, it would be\\r , more wholesomely expended on the treadmill than in a musical\\r , instrument.  He made no answer: being occupied mentally bewailing the\\r , loss of the flute, which had been confiscated for the use of the\\r , county:  so Nancy passed on to the next cell, and knocked there.\\r , \\r , \\'Well!\\' cried a faint and feeble voice.\\r , \\r , \\'Is there a little boy here?\\' inquired Nancy, with a preliminary sob.\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' replied the voice; \\'God forbid.\\'\\r , \\r , This was a vagrant of sixty-five, who was going to prison for _not_\\r , playing the flute; or, in other words, for begging in the streets, and\\r , doing nothing for his livelihood.  In the next cell was another man,\\r , who was going to the same prison for hawking tin saucepans without\\r , license; thereby doing something for his living, in defiance of the\\r , Stamp-office.\\r , \\r , But, as neither of these criminals answered to the name of Oliver, or\\r , knew anything about him, Nancy made straight up to the bluff officer in\\r , the striped waistcoat; and with the most piteous wailings and\\r , lamentations, rendered more piteous by a prompt and efficient use of\\r , the street-door key and the little basket, demanded her own dear\\r , brother.\\r , \\r , \\'I haven\\'t got him, my dear,\\' said the old man.\\r , \\r , \\'Where is he?\\' screamed Nancy, in a distracted manner.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, the gentleman\\'s got him,\\' replied the officer.\\r , \\r , \\'What gentleman!  Oh, gracious heavens!  What gentleman?\\' exclaimed\\r , Nancy.\\r , \\r , In reply to this incoherent questioning, the old man informed the\\r , deeply affected sister that Oliver had been taken ill in the office,\\r , and discharged in consequence of a witness having proved the robbery to\\r , have been committed by another boy, not in custody; and that the\\r , prosecutor had carried him away, in an insensible condition, to his own\\r , residence:  of and concerning which, all the informant knew was, that\\r , it was somewhere in Pentonville, he having heard that word mentioned in\\r , the directions to the coachman.\\r , \\r , In a dreadful state of doubt and uncertainty, the agonised young woman\\r , staggered to the gate, and then, exchanging her faltering walk for a\\r , swift run, returned by the most devious and complicated route she could\\r , think of, to the domicile of the Jew.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bill Sikes no sooner heard the account of the expedition delivered,\\r , than he very hastily called up the white dog, and, putting on his hat,\\r , expeditiously departed:  without devoting any time to the formality of\\r , wishing the company good-morning.\\r , \\r , \\'We must know where he is, my dears; he must be found,\\' said the Jew\\r , greatly excited.  \\'Charley, do nothing but skulk about, till you bring\\r , home some news of him!  Nancy, my dear, I must have him found.  I trust\\r , to you, my dear,--to you and the Artful for everything!  Stay, stay,\\'\\r , added the Jew, unlocking a drawer with a shaking hand; \\'there\\'s money,\\r , my dears.  I shall shut up this shop to-night.  You\\'ll know where to\\r , find me!  Don\\'t stop here a minute.  Not an instant, my dears!\\'\\r , \\r , With these words, he pushed them from the room:  and carefully\\r , double-locking and barring the door behind them, drew from its place of\\r , concealment the box which he had unintentionally disclosed to Oliver.\\r , Then, he hastily proceeded to dispose the watches and jewellery beneath\\r , his clothing.\\r , \\r , A rap at the door startled him in this occupation.  \\'Who\\'s there?\\' he\\r , cried in a shrill tone.\\r , \\r , \\'Me!\\' replied the voice of the Dodger, through the key-hole.\\r , \\r , \\'What now?\\' cried the Jew impatiently.\\r , \\r , \\'Is he to be kidnapped to the other ken, Nancy says?\\' inquired the\\r , Dodger.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' replied the Jew, \\'wherever she lays hands on him.  Find him,\\r , find him out, that\\'s all.  I shall know what to do next; never fear.\\'\\r , \\r , The boy murmured a reply of intelligence:  and hurried downstairs after\\r , his companions.\\r , \\r , \\'He has not peached so far,\\' said the Jew as he pursued his occupation.\\r , \\'If he means to blab us among his new friends, we may stop his mouth\\r , yet.\\'\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XIV\\r , \\r , COMPRISING FURTHER PARTICULARS OF OLIVER\\'S STAY AT MR. BROWNLOW\\'S, WITH\\r , THE REMARKABLE PREDICTION WHICH ONE MR. GRIMWIG UTTERED CONCERNING HIM,\\r , WHEN HE WENT OUT ON AN ERRAND\\r , \\r , Oliver soon recovering from the fainting-fit into which Mr. Brownlow\\'s\\r , abrupt exclamation had thrown him, the subject of the picture was\\r , carefully avoided, both by the old gentleman and Mrs. Bedwin, in the\\r , conversation that ensued:  which indeed bore no reference to Oliver\\'s\\r , history or prospects, but was confined to such topics as might amuse\\r , without exciting him.  He was still too weak to get up to breakfast;\\r , but, when he came down into the housekeeper\\'s room next day, his first\\r , act was to cast an eager glance at the wall, in the hope of again\\r , looking on the face of the beautiful lady.  His expectations were\\r , disappointed, however, for the picture had been removed.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!\\' said the housekeeper, watching the direction of Oliver\\'s eyes.\\r , \\'It is gone, you see.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I see it is ma\\'am,\\' replied Oliver.  \\'Why have they taken it away?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It has been taken down, child, because Mr. Brownlow said, that as it\\r , seemed to worry you, perhaps it might prevent your getting well, you\\r , know,\\' rejoined the old lady.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, no, indeed.  It didn\\'t worry me, ma\\'am,\\' said Oliver. \\'I liked to\\r , see it.  I quite loved it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, well!\\' said the old lady, good-humouredly; \\'you get well as fast\\r , as ever you can, dear, and it shall be hung up again. There!  I promise\\r , you that!  Now, let us talk about something else.\\'\\r , \\r , This was all the information Oliver could obtain about the picture at\\r , that time.  As the old lady had been so kind to him in his illness, he\\r , endeavoured to think no more of the subject just then; so he listened\\r , attentively to a great many stories she told him, about an amiable and\\r , handsome daughter of hers, who was married to an amiable and handsome\\r , man, and lived in the country; and about a son, who was clerk to a\\r , merchant in the West Indies; and who was, also, such a good young man,\\r , and wrote such dutiful letters home four times a-year, that it brought\\r , the tears into her eyes to talk about them.  When the old lady had\\r , expatiated, a long time, on the excellences of her children, and the\\r , merits of her kind good husband besides, who had been dead and gone,\\r , poor dear soul! just six-and-twenty years, it was time to have tea.\\r , After tea she began to teach Oliver cribbage: which he learnt as\\r , quickly as she could teach:  and at which game they played, with great\\r , interest and gravity, until it was time for the invalid to have some\\r , warm wine and water, with a slice of dry toast, and then to go cosily\\r , to bed.\\r , \\r , They were happy days, those of Oliver\\'s recovery.  Everything was so\\r , quiet, and neat, and orderly; everybody so kind and gentle; that after\\r , the noise and turbulence in the midst of which he had always lived, it\\r , seemed like Heaven itself.  He was no sooner strong enough to put his\\r , clothes on, properly, than Mr. Brownlow caused a complete new suit, and\\r , a new cap, and a new pair of shoes, to be provided for him.  As Oliver\\r , was told that he might do what he liked with the old clothes, he gave\\r , them to a servant who had been very kind to him, and asked her to sell\\r , them to a Jew, and keep the money for herself.  This she very readily\\r , did; and, as Oliver looked out of the parlour window, and saw the Jew\\r , roll them up in his bag and walk away, he felt quite delighted to think\\r , that they were safely gone, and that there was now no possible danger\\r , of his ever being able to wear them again.  They were sad rags, to tell\\r , the truth; and Oliver had never had a new suit before.\\r , \\r , One evening, about a week after the affair of the picture, as he was\\r , sitting talking to Mrs. Bedwin, there came a message down from Mr.\\r , Brownlow, that if Oliver Twist felt pretty well, he should like to see\\r , him in his study, and talk to him a little while.\\r , \\r , \\'Bless us, and save us!  Wash your hands, and let me part your hair\\r , nicely for you, child,\\' said Mrs. Bedwin.  \\'Dear heart alive!  If we\\r , had known he would have asked for you, we would have put you a clean\\r , collar on, and made you as smart as sixpence!\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver did as the old lady bade him; and, although she lamented\\r , grievously, meanwhile, that there was not even time to crimp the little\\r , frill that bordered his shirt-collar; he looked so delicate and\\r , handsome, despite that important personal advantage, that she went so\\r , far as to say:  looking at him with great complacency from head to\\r , foot, that she really didn\\'t think it would have been possible, on the\\r , longest notice, to have made much difference in him for the better.\\r , \\r , Thus encouraged, Oliver tapped at the study door.  On Mr. Brownlow\\r , calling to him to come in, he found himself in a little back room,\\r , quite full of books, with a window, looking into some pleasant little\\r , gardens.  There was a table drawn up before the window, at which Mr.\\r , Brownlow was seated reading.  When he saw Oliver, he pushed the book\\r , away from him, and told him to come near the table, and sit down.\\r , Oliver complied; marvelling where the people could be found to read\\r , such a great number of books as seemed to be written to make the world\\r , wiser.  Which is still a marvel to more experienced people than Oliver\\r , Twist, every day of their lives.\\r , \\r , \\'There are a good many books, are there not, my boy?\\' said Mr.\\r , Brownlow, observing the curiosity with which Oliver surveyed the\\r , shelves that reached from the floor to the ceiling.\\r , \\r , \\'A great number, sir,\\' replied Oliver.  \\'I never saw so many.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You shall read them, if you behave well,\\' said the old gentleman\\r , kindly; \\'and you will like that, better than looking at the\\r , outsides,--that is, some cases; because there are books of which the\\r , backs and covers are by far the best parts.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I suppose they are those heavy ones, sir,\\' said Oliver, pointing to\\r , some large quartos, with a good deal of gilding about the binding.\\r , \\r , \\'Not always those,\\' said the old gentleman, patting Oliver on the head,\\r , and smiling as he did so; \\'there are other equally heavy ones, though\\r , of a much smaller size.  How should you like to grow up a clever man,\\r , and write books, eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I think I would rather read them, sir,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'What! wouldn\\'t you like to be a book-writer?\\' said the old gentleman.\\r , \\r , Oliver considered a little while; and at last said, he should think it\\r , would be a much better thing to be a book-seller; upon which the old\\r , gentleman laughed heartily, and declared he had said a very good thing.\\r , Which Oliver felt glad to have done, though he by no means knew what it\\r , was.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, well,\\' said the old gentleman, composing his features. \\'Don\\'t be\\r , afraid!  We won\\'t make an author of you, while there\\'s an honest trade\\r , to be learnt, or brick-making to turn to.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Thank you, sir,\\' said Oliver.  At the earnest manner of his reply, the\\r , old gentleman laughed again; and said something about a curious\\r , instinct, which Oliver, not understanding, paid no very great attention\\r , to.\\r , \\r , \\'Now,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, speaking if possible in a kinder, but at the\\r , same time in a much more serious manner, than Oliver had ever known him\\r , assume yet, \\'I want you to pay great attention, my boy, to what I am\\r , going to say.  I shall talk to you without any reserve; because I am\\r , sure you are well able to understand me, as many older persons would\\r , be.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, don\\'t tell you are going to send me away, sir, pray!\\' exclaimed\\r , Oliver, alarmed at the serious tone of the old gentleman\\'s\\r , commencement!  \\'Don\\'t turn me out of doors to wander in the streets\\r , again.  Let me stay here, and be a servant.  Don\\'t send me back to the\\r , wretched place I came from.  Have mercy upon a poor boy, sir!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'My dear child,\\' said the old gentleman, moved by the warmth of\\r , Oliver\\'s sudden appeal; \\'you need not be afraid of my deserting you,\\r , unless you give me cause.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I never, never will, sir,\\' interposed Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'I hope not,\\' rejoined the old gentleman.  \\'I do not think you ever\\r , will.  I have been deceived, before, in the objects whom I have\\r , endeavoured to benefit; but I feel strongly disposed to trust you,\\r , nevertheless; and I am more interested in your behalf than I can well\\r , account for, even to myself.  The persons on whom I have bestowed my\\r , dearest love, lie deep in their graves; but, although the happiness and\\r , delight of my life lie buried there too, I have not made a coffin of my\\r , heart, and sealed it up, forever, on my best affections.  Deep\\r , affliction has but strengthened and refined them.\\'\\r , \\r , As the old gentleman said this in a low voice:  more to himself than to\\r , his companion:  and as he remained silent for a short time afterwards:\\r , Oliver sat quite still.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, well!\\' said the old gentleman at length, in a more cheerful\\r , tone, \\'I only say this, because you have a young heart; and knowing\\r , that I have suffered great pain and sorrow, you will be more careful,\\r , perhaps, not to wound me again.  You say you are an orphan, without a\\r , friend in the world; all the inquiries I have been able to make,\\r , confirm the statement.  Let me hear your story; where you come from;\\r , who brought you up; and how you got into the company in which I found\\r , you.  Speak the truth, and you shall not be friendless while I live.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver\\'s sobs checked his utterance for some minutes; when he was on\\r , the point of beginning to relate how he had been brought up at the\\r , farm, and carried to the workhouse by Mr. Bumble, a peculiarly\\r , impatient little double-knock was heard at the street-door:  and the\\r , servant, running upstairs, announced Mr. Grimwig.\\r , \\r , \\'Is he coming up?\\' inquired Mr. Brownlow.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, sir,\\' replied the servant.  \\'He asked if there were any muffins\\r , in the house; and, when I told him yes, he said he had come to tea.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Brownlow smiled; and, turning to Oliver, said that Mr. Grimwig was\\r , an old friend of his, and he must not mind his being a little rough in\\r , his manners; for he was a worthy creature at bottom, as he had reason\\r , to know.\\r , \\r , \\'Shall I go downstairs, sir?\\' inquired Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow, \\'I would rather you remained here.\\'\\r , \\r , At this moment, there walked into the room:  supporting himself by a\\r , thick stick:  a stout old gentleman, rather lame in one leg, who was\\r , dressed in a blue coat, striped waistcoat, nankeen breeches and\\r , gaiters, and a broad-brimmed white hat, with the sides turned up with\\r , green.  A very small-plaited shirt frill stuck out from his waistcoat;\\r , and a very long steel watch-chain, with nothing but a key at the end,\\r , dangled loosely below it.  The ends of his white neckerchief were\\r , twisted into a ball about the size of an orange; the variety of shapes\\r , into which his countenance was twisted, defy description.  He had a\\r , manner of screwing his head on one side when he spoke; and of looking\\r , out of the corners of his eyes at the same time:  which irresistibly\\r , reminded the beholder of a parrot.  In this attitude, he fixed himself,\\r , the moment he made his appearance; and, holding out a small piece of\\r , orange-peel at arm\\'s length, exclaimed, in a growling, discontented\\r , voice.\\r , \\r , \\'Look here! do you see this!  Isn\\'t it a most wonderful and\\r , extraordinary thing that I can\\'t call at a man\\'s house but I find a\\r , piece of this poor surgeon\\'s friend on the staircase? I\\'ve been lamed\\r , with orange-peel once, and I know orange-peel will be my death, or I\\'ll\\r , be content to eat my own head, sir!\\'\\r , \\r , This was the handsome offer with which Mr. Grimwig backed and confirmed\\r , nearly every assertion he made; and it was the more singular in his\\r , case, because, even admitting for the sake of argument, the possibility\\r , of scientific improvements being brought to that pass which will enable\\r , a gentleman to eat his own head in the event of his being so disposed,\\r , Mr. Grimwig\\'s head was such a particularly large one, that the most\\r , sanguine man alive could hardly entertain a hope of being able to get\\r , through it at a sitting--to put entirely out of the question, a very\\r , thick coating of powder.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ll eat my head, sir,\\' repeated Mr. Grimwig, striking his stick upon\\r , the ground.  \\'Hallo! what\\'s that!\\' looking at Oliver, and retreating a\\r , pace or two.\\r , \\r , \\'This is young Oliver Twist, whom we were speaking about,\\' said Mr.\\r , Brownlow.\\r , \\r , Oliver bowed.\\r , \\r , \\'You don\\'t mean to say that\\'s the boy who had the fever, I hope?\\' said\\r , Mr. Grimwig, recoiling a little more.  \\'Wait a minute! Don\\'t speak!\\r , Stop--\\' continued Mr. Grimwig, abruptly, losing all dread of the fever\\r , in his triumph at the discovery; \\'that\\'s the boy who had the orange!\\r , If that\\'s not the boy, sir, who had the orange, and threw this bit of\\r , peel upon the staircase, I\\'ll eat my head, and his too.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, no, he has not had one,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, laughing. \\'Come!  Put\\r , down your hat; and speak to my young friend.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I feel strongly on this subject, sir,\\' said the irritable old\\r , gentleman, drawing off his gloves.  \\'There\\'s always more or less\\r , orange-peel on the pavement in our street; and I _know_ it\\'s put there\\r , by the surgeon\\'s boy at the corner.  A young woman stumbled over a bit\\r , last night, and fell against my garden-railings; directly she got up I\\r , saw her look towards his infernal red lamp with the pantomime-light.\\r , \"Don\\'t go to him,\" I called out of the window, \"he\\'s an assassin!  A\\r , man-trap!\"  So he is.  If he is not--\\'  Here the irascible old\\r , gentleman gave a great knock on the ground with his stick; which was\\r , always understood, by his friends, to imply the customary offer,\\r , whenever it was not expressed in words. Then, still keeping his stick\\r , in his hand, he sat down; and, opening a double eye-glass, which he\\r , wore attached to a broad black riband, took a view of Oliver:  who,\\r , seeing that he was the object of inspection, coloured, and bowed again.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s the boy, is it?\\' said Mr. Grimwig, at length.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s the boy,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow.\\r , \\r , \\'How are you, boy?\\' said Mr. Grimwig.\\r , \\r , \\'A great deal better, thank you, sir,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , Mr. Brownlow, seeming to apprehend that his singular friend was about\\r , to say something disagreeable, asked Oliver to step downstairs and tell\\r , Mrs. Bedwin they were ready for tea; which, as he did not half like the\\r , visitor\\'s manner, he was very happy to do.\\r , \\r , \\'He is a nice-looking boy, is he not?\\' inquired Mr. Brownlow.\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t know,\\' replied Mr. Grimwig, pettishly.\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t know?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No.  I don\\'t know.  I never see any difference in boys.  I only knew\\r , two sort of boys.  Mealy boys, and beef-faced boys.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And which is Oliver?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Mealy.  I know a friend who has a beef-faced boy; a fine boy, they\\r , call him; with a round head, and red cheeks, and glaring eyes; a horrid\\r , boy; with a body and limbs that appear to be swelling out of the seams\\r , of his blue clothes; with the voice of a pilot, and the appetite of a\\r , wolf.  I know him!  The wretch!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Come,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, \\'these are not the characteristics of young\\r , Oliver Twist; so he needn\\'t excite your wrath.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'They are not,\\' replied Mr. Grimwig.  \\'He may have worse.\\'\\r , \\r , Here, Mr. Brownlow coughed impatiently; which appeared to afford Mr.\\r , Grimwig the most exquisite delight.\\r , \\r , \\'He may have worse, I say,\\' repeated Mr. Grimwig.  \\'Where does he come\\r , from!  Who is he?  What is he?  He has had a fever.  What of that?\\r , Fevers are not peculiar to good people; are they?  Bad people have\\r , fevers sometimes; haven\\'t they, eh?  I knew a man who was hung in\\r , Jamaica for murdering his master.  He had had a fever six times; he\\r , wasn\\'t recommended to mercy on that account.  Pooh! nonsense!\\'\\r , \\r , Now, the fact was, that in the inmost recesses of his own heart, Mr.\\r , Grimwig was strongly disposed to admit that Oliver\\'s appearance and\\r , manner were unusually prepossessing; but he had a strong appetite for\\r , contradiction, sharpened on this occasion by the finding of the\\r , orange-peel; and, inwardly determining that no man should dictate to\\r , him whether a boy was well-looking or not, he had resolved, from the\\r , first, to oppose his friend.  When Mr. Brownlow admitted that on no one\\r , point of inquiry could he yet return a satisfactory answer; and that he\\r , had postponed any investigation into Oliver\\'s previous history until he\\r , thought the boy was strong enough to hear it; Mr. Grimwig chuckled\\r , maliciously.  And he demanded, with a sneer, whether the housekeeper\\r , was in the habit of counting the plate at night; because if she didn\\'t\\r , find a table-spoon or two missing some sunshiny morning, why, he would\\r , be content to--and so forth.\\r , \\r , All this, Mr. Brownlow, although himself somewhat of an impetuous\\r , gentleman:  knowing his friend\\'s peculiarities, bore with great good\\r , humour; as Mr. Grimwig, at tea, was graciously pleased to express his\\r , entire approval of the muffins, matters went on very smoothly; and\\r , Oliver, who made one of the party, began to feel more at his ease than\\r , he had yet done in the fierce old gentleman\\'s presence.\\r , \\r , \\'And when are you going to hear a full, true, and particular account of\\r , the life and adventures of Oliver Twist?\\' asked Grimwig of Mr.\\r , Brownlow, at the conclusion of the meal; looking sideways at Oliver, as\\r , he resumed his subject.\\r , \\r , \\'To-morrow morning,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow.  \\'I would rather he was\\r , alone with me at the time.  Come up to me to-morrow morning at ten\\r , o\\'clock, my dear.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, sir,\\' replied Oliver.  He answered with some hesitation, because\\r , he was confused by Mr. Grimwig\\'s looking so hard at him.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ll tell you what,\\' whispered that gentleman to Mr. Brownlow; \\'he\\r , won\\'t come up to you to-morrow morning.  I saw him hesitate. He is\\r , deceiving you, my good friend.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ll swear he is not,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow, warmly.\\r , \\r , \\'If he is not,\\' said Mr. Grimwig, \\'I\\'ll--\\' and down went the stick.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ll answer for that boy\\'s truth with my life!\\' said Mr. Brownlow,\\r , knocking the table.\\r , \\r , \\'And I for his falsehood with my head!\\' rejoined Mr. Grimwig, knocking\\r , the table also.\\r , \\r , \\'We shall see,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, checking his rising anger.\\r , \\r , \\'We will,\\' replied Mr. Grimwig, with a provoking smile;  \\'we will.\\'\\r , \\r , As fate would have it, Mrs. Bedwin chanced to bring in, at this moment,\\r , a small parcel of books, which Mr. Brownlow had that morning purchased\\r , of the identical bookstall-keeper, who has already figured in this\\r , history; having laid them on the table, she prepared to leave the room.\\r , \\r , \\'Stop the boy, Mrs. Bedwin!\\' said Mr. Brownlow; \\'there is something to\\r , go back.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He has gone, sir,\\' replied Mrs. Bedwin.\\r , \\r , \\'Call after him,\\' said Mr. Brownlow; \\'it\\'s particular.  He is a poor\\r , man, and they are not paid for.  There are some books to be taken back,\\r , too.\\'\\r , \\r , The street-door was opened.  Oliver ran one way; and the girl ran\\r , another; and Mrs. Bedwin stood on the step and screamed for the boy;\\r , but there was no boy in sight.  Oliver and the girl returned, in a\\r , breathless state, to report that there were no tidings of him.\\r , \\r , \\'Dear me, I am very sorry for that,\\' exclaimed Mr. Brownlow; \\'I\\r , particularly wished those books to be returned to-night.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Send Oliver with them,\\' said Mr. Grimwig, with an ironical smile; \\'he\\r , will be sure to deliver them safely, you know.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes; do let me take them, if you please, sir,\\' said Oliver. \\'I\\'ll run\\r , all the way, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , The old gentleman was just going to say that Oliver should not go out\\r , on any account; when a most malicious cough from Mr. Grimwig determined\\r , him that he should; and that, by his prompt discharge of the\\r , commission, he should prove to him the injustice of his suspicions:  on\\r , this head at least:  at once.\\r , \\r , \\'You _shall_ go, my dear,\\' said the old gentleman.  \\'The books are on a\\r , chair by my table.  Fetch them down.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver, delighted to be of use, brought down the books under his arm in\\r , a great bustle; and waited, cap in hand, to hear what message he was to\\r , take.\\r , \\r , \\'You are to say,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, glancing steadily at Grimwig; \\'you\\r , are to say that you have brought those books back; and that you have\\r , come to pay the four pound ten I owe him.  This is a five-pound note,\\r , so you will have to bring me back, ten shillings change.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I won\\'t be ten minutes, sir,\\' said Oliver, eagerly.  Having buttoned\\r , up the bank-note in his jacket pocket, and placed the books carefully\\r , under his arm, he made a respectful bow, and left the room.  Mrs.\\r , Bedwin followed him to the street-door, giving him many directions\\r , about the nearest way, and the name of the bookseller, and the name of\\r , the street:  all of which Oliver said he clearly understood.  Having\\r , superadded many injunctions to be sure and not take cold, the old lady\\r , at length permitted him to depart.\\r , \\r , \\'Bless his sweet face!\\' said the old lady, looking after him. \\'I can\\'t\\r , bear, somehow, to let him go out of my sight.\\'\\r , \\r , At this moment, Oliver looked gaily round, and nodded before he turned\\r , the corner.  The old lady smilingly returned his salutation, and,\\r , closing the door, went back to her own room.\\r , \\r , \\'Let me see; he\\'ll be back in twenty minutes, at the longest,\\' said Mr.\\r , Brownlow, pulling out his watch, and placing it on the table.  \\'It will\\r , be dark by that time.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh! you really expect him to come back, do you?\\' inquired Mr. Grimwig.\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t you?\\' asked Mr. Brownlow, smiling.\\r , \\r , The spirit of contradiction was strong in Mr. Grimwig\\'s breast, at the\\r , moment; and it was rendered stronger by his friend\\'s confident smile.\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' he said, smiting the table with his fist, \\'I do not. The boy has\\r , a new suit of clothes on his back, a set of valuable books under his\\r , arm, and a five-pound note in his pocket.  He\\'ll join his old friends\\r , the thieves, and laugh at you.  If ever that boy returns to this house,\\r , sir, I\\'ll eat my head.\\'\\r , \\r , With these words he drew his chair closer to the table; and there the\\r , two friends sat, in silent expectation, with the watch between them.\\r , \\r , It is worthy of remark, as illustrating the importance we attach to our\\r , own judgments, and the pride with which we put forth our most rash and\\r , hasty conclusions, that, although Mr. Grimwig was not by any means a\\r , bad-hearted man, and though he would have been unfeignedly sorry to see\\r , his respected friend duped and deceived, he really did most earnestly\\r , and strongly hope at that moment, that Oliver Twist might not come back.\\r , \\r , It grew so dark, that the figures on the dial-plate were scarcely\\r , discernible; but there the two old gentlemen continued to sit, in\\r , silence, with the watch between them.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XV\\r , \\r , SHOWING HOW VERY FOND OF OLIVER TWIST, THE MERRY OLD JEW AND MISS NANCY\\r , WERE\\r , \\r , In the obscure parlour of a low public-house, in the filthiest part of\\r , Little Saffron Hill; a dark and gloomy den, where a flaring gas-light\\r , burnt all day in the winter-time; and where no ray of sun ever shone in\\r , the summer:  there sat, brooding over a little pewter measure and a\\r , small glass, strongly impregnated with the smell of liquor, a man in a\\r , velveteen coat, drab shorts, half-boots and stockings, whom even by\\r , that dim light no experienced agent of the police would have hesitated\\r , to recognise as Mr. William Sikes.  At his feet, sat a white-coated,\\r , red-eyed dog; who occupied himself, alternately, in winking at his\\r , master with both eyes at the same time; and in licking a large, fresh\\r , cut on one side of his mouth, which appeared to be the result of some\\r , recent conflict.\\r , \\r , \\'Keep quiet, you warmint!  Keep quiet!\\' said Mr. Sikes, suddenly\\r , breaking silence.  Whether his meditations were so intense as to be\\r , disturbed by the dog\\'s winking, or whether his feelings were so wrought\\r , upon by his reflections that they required all the relief derivable\\r , from kicking an unoffending animal to allay them, is matter for\\r , argument and consideration.  Whatever was the cause, the effect was a\\r , kick and a curse, bestowed upon the dog simultaneously.\\r , \\r , Dogs are not generally apt to revenge injuries inflicted upon them by\\r , their masters; but Mr. Sikes\\'s dog, having faults of temper in common\\r , with his owner, and labouring, perhaps, at this moment, under a\\r , powerful sense of injury, made no more ado but at once fixed his teeth\\r , in one of the half-boots.  Having given in a hearty shake, he retired,\\r , growling, under a form; just escaping the pewter measure which Mr.\\r , Sikes levelled at his head.\\r , \\r , \\'You would, would you?\\' said Sikes, seizing the poker in one hand, and\\r , deliberately opening with the other a large clasp-knife, which he drew\\r , from his pocket.  \\'Come here, you born devil!  Come here!  D\\'ye hear?\\'\\r , \\r , The dog no doubt heard; because Mr. Sikes spoke in the very harshest\\r , key of a very harsh voice; but, appearing to entertain some\\r , unaccountable objection to having his throat cut, he remained where he\\r , was, and growled more fiercely than before:  at the same time grasping\\r , the end of the poker between his teeth, and biting at it like a wild\\r , beast.\\r , \\r , This resistance only infuriated Mr. Sikes the more; who, dropping on\\r , his knees, began to assail the animal most furiously.  The dog jumped\\r , from right to left, and from left to right; snapping, growling, and\\r , barking; the man thrust and swore, and struck and blasphemed; and the\\r , struggle was reaching a most critical point for one or other; when, the\\r , door suddenly opening, the dog darted out:  leaving Bill Sikes with the\\r , poker and the clasp-knife in his hands.\\r , \\r , There must always be two parties to a quarrel, says the old adage.  Mr.\\r , Sikes, being disappointed of the dog\\'s participation, at once\\r , transferred his share in the quarrel to the new comer.\\r , \\r , \\'What the devil do you come in between me and my dog for?\\' said Sikes,\\r , with a fierce gesture.\\r , \\r , \\'I didn\\'t know, my dear, I didn\\'t know,\\' replied Fagin, humbly; for the\\r , Jew was the new comer.\\r , \\r , \\'Didn\\'t know, you white-livered thief!\\' growled Sikes. \\'Couldn\\'t you\\r , hear the noise?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not a sound of it, as I\\'m a living man, Bill,\\' replied the Jew.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh no!  You hear nothing, you don\\'t,\\' retorted Sikes with a fierce\\r , sneer.  \\'Sneaking in and out, so as nobody hears how you come or go!  I\\r , wish you had been the dog, Fagin, half a minute ago.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why?\\' inquired the Jew with a forced smile.\\r , \\r , \\'Cause the government, as cares for the lives of such men as you, as\\r , haven\\'t half the pluck of curs, lets a man kill a dog how he likes,\\'\\r , replied Sikes, shutting up the knife with a very expressive look;\\r , \\'that\\'s why.\\'\\r , \\r , The Jew rubbed his hands; and, sitting down at the table, affected to\\r , laugh at the pleasantry of his friend.  He was obviously very ill at\\r , ease, however.\\r , \\r , \\'Grin away,\\' said Sikes, replacing the poker, and surveying him with\\r , savage contempt; \\'grin away.  You\\'ll never have the laugh at me,\\r , though, unless it\\'s behind a nightcap.  I\\'ve got the upper hand over\\r , you, Fagin; and, d--me, I\\'ll keep it.  There!  If I go, you go; so take\\r , care of me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, well, my dear,\\' said the Jew, \\'I know all that; we--we--have a\\r , mutual interest, Bill,--a mutual interest.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Humph,\\' said Sikes, as if he thought the interest lay rather more on\\r , the Jew\\'s side than on his.  \\'Well, what have you got to say to me?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s all passed safe through the melting-pot,\\' replied Fagin, \\'and\\r , this is your share.  It\\'s rather more than it ought to be, my dear; but\\r , as I know you\\'ll do me a good turn another time, and--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Stow that gammon,\\' interposed the robber, impatiently. \\'Where is it?\\r , Hand over!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, yes, Bill; give me time, give me time,\\' replied the Jew,\\r , soothingly.  \\'Here it is!  All safe!\\'  As he spoke, he drew forth an\\r , old cotton handkerchief from his breast; and untying a large knot in\\r , one corner, produced a small brown-paper packet.  Sikes, snatching it\\r , from him, hastily opened it; and proceeded to count the sovereigns it\\r , contained.\\r , \\r , \\'This is all, is it?\\' inquired Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'All,\\' replied the Jew.\\r , \\r , \\'You haven\\'t opened the parcel and swallowed one or two as you come\\r , along, have you?\\' inquired Sikes, suspiciously. \\'Don\\'t put on an\\r , injured look at the question; you\\'ve done it many a time. Jerk the\\r , tinkler.\\'\\r , \\r , These words, in plain English, conveyed an injunction to ring the bell.\\r , It was answered by another Jew:  younger than Fagin, but nearly as vile\\r , and repulsive in appearance.\\r , \\r , Bill Sikes merely pointed to the empty measure.  The Jew, perfectly\\r , understanding the hint, retired to fill it:  previously exchanging a\\r , remarkable look with Fagin, who raised his eyes for an instant, as if\\r , in expectation of it, and shook his head in reply; so slightly that the\\r , action would have been almost imperceptible to an observant third\\r , person.  It was lost upon Sikes, who was stooping at the moment to tie\\r , the boot-lace which the dog had torn.  Possibly, if he had observed the\\r , brief interchange of signals, he might have thought that it boded no\\r , good to him.\\r , \\r , \\'Is anybody here, Barney?\\' inquired Fagin; speaking, now that that\\r , Sikes was looking on, without raising his eyes from the ground.\\r , \\r , \\'Dot a shoul,\\' replied Barney; whose words:  whether they came from the\\r , heart or not:  made their way through the nose.\\r , \\r , \\'Nobody?\\' inquired Fagin, in a tone of surprise:  which perhaps might\\r , mean that Barney was at liberty to tell the truth.\\r , \\r , \\'Dobody but Biss Dadsy,\\' replied Barney.\\r , \\r , \\'Nancy!\\' exclaimed Sikes.  \\'Where?  Strike me blind, if I don\\'t honour\\r , that \\'ere girl, for her native talents.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'She\\'s bid havid a plate of boiled beef id the bar,\\' replied Barney.\\r , \\r , \\'Send her here,\\' said Sikes, pouring out a glass of liquor. \\'Send her\\r , here.\\'\\r , \\r , Barney looked timidly at Fagin, as if for permission; the Jew remaining\\r , silent, and not lifting his eyes from the ground, he retired; and\\r , presently returned, ushering in Nancy; who was decorated with the\\r , bonnet, apron, basket, and street-door key, complete.\\r , \\r , \\'You are on the scent, are you, Nancy?\\' inquired Sikes, proffering the\\r , glass.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, I am, Bill,\\' replied the young lady, disposing of its contents;\\r , \\'and tired enough of it I am, too.  The young brat\\'s been ill and\\r , confined to the crib; and--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah, Nancy, dear!\\' said Fagin, looking up.\\r , \\r , Now, whether a peculiar contraction of the Jew\\'s red eye-brows, and a\\r , half closing of his deeply-set eyes, warned Miss Nancy that she was\\r , disposed to be too communicative, is not a matter of much importance.\\r , The fact is all we need care for here; and the fact is, that she\\r , suddenly checked herself, and with several gracious smiles upon Mr.\\r , Sikes, turned the conversation to other matters. In about ten minutes\\'\\r , time, Mr. Fagin was seized with a fit of coughing; upon which Nancy\\r , pulled her shawl over her shoulders, and declared it was time to go.\\r , Mr. Sikes, finding that he was walking a short part of her way himself,\\r , expressed his intention of accompanying her; they went away together,\\r , followed, at a little distant, by the dog, who slunk out of a back-yard\\r , as soon as his master was out of sight.\\r , \\r , The Jew thrust his head out of the room door when Sikes had left it;\\r , looked after him as he walked up the dark passage; shook his clenched\\r , fist; muttered a deep curse; and then, with a horrible grin, reseated\\r , himself at the table; where he was soon deeply absorbed in the\\r , interesting pages of the Hue-and-Cry.\\r , \\r , Meanwhile, Oliver Twist, little dreaming that he was within so very\\r , short a distance of the merry old gentleman, was on his way to the\\r , book-stall.  When he got into Clerkenwell, he accidently turned down a\\r , by-street which was not exactly in his way; but not discovering his\\r , mistake until he had got half-way down it, and knowing it must lead in\\r , the right direction, he did not think it worth while to turn back; and\\r , so marched on, as quickly as he could, with the books under his arm.\\r , \\r , He was walking along, thinking how happy and contented he ought to\\r , feel; and how much he would give for only one look at poor little Dick,\\r , who, starved and beaten, might be weeping bitterly at that very moment;\\r , when he was startled by a young woman screaming out very loud.  \\'Oh, my\\r , dear brother!\\'  And he had hardly looked up, to see what the matter\\r , was, when he was stopped by having a pair of arms thrown tight round\\r , his neck.\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t,\\' cried Oliver, struggling.  \\'Let go of me.  Who is it? What are\\r , you stopping me for?\\'\\r , \\r , The only reply to this, was a great number of loud lamentations from\\r , the young woman who had embraced him; and who had a little basket and a\\r , street-door key in her hand.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh my gracious!\\' said the young woman, \\'I have found him!  Oh! Oliver!\\r , Oliver!  Oh you naughty boy, to make me suffer such distress on your\\r , account!  Come home, dear, come.  Oh, I\\'ve found him.  Thank gracious\\r , goodness heavins, I\\'ve found him!\\'  With these incoherent exclamations,\\r , the young woman burst into another fit of crying, and got so dreadfully\\r , hysterical, that a couple of women who came up at the moment asked a\\r , butcher\\'s boy with a shiny head of hair anointed with suet, who was\\r , also looking on, whether he didn\\'t think he had better run for the\\r , doctor.  To which, the butcher\\'s boy:  who appeared of a lounging, not\\r , to say indolent disposition:  replied, that he thought not.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, no, no, never mind,\\' said the young woman, grasping Oliver\\'s hand;\\r , \\'I\\'m better now.  Come home directly, you cruel boy! Come!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, ma\\'am,\\' replied the young woman, \\'he ran away, near a month ago,\\r , from his parents, who are hard-working and respectable people; and went\\r , and joined a set of thieves and bad characters; and almost broke his\\r , mother\\'s heart.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Young wretch!\\' said one woman.\\r , \\r , \\'Go home, do, you little brute,\\' said the other.\\r , \\r , \\'I am not,\\' replied Oliver, greatly alarmed.  \\'I don\\'t know her. I\\r , haven\\'t any sister, or father and mother either.  I\\'m an orphan; I live\\r , at Pentonville.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Only hear him, how he braves it out!\\' cried the young woman.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, it\\'s Nancy!\\' exclaimed Oliver; who now saw her face for the first\\r , time; and started back, in irrepressible astonishment.\\r , \\r , \\'You see he knows me!\\' cried Nancy, appealing to the bystanders. \\'He\\r , can\\'t help himself.  Make him come home, there\\'s good people, or he\\'ll\\r , kill his dear mother and father, and break my heart!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What the devil\\'s this?\\' said a man, bursting out of a beer-shop, with\\r , a white dog at his heels; \\'young Oliver! Come home to your poor mother,\\r , you young dog!  Come home directly.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t belong to them.  I don\\'t know them.  Help! help!\\' cried\\r , Oliver, struggling in the man\\'s powerful grasp.\\r , \\r , \\'Help!\\' repeated the man.  \\'Yes; I\\'ll help you, you young rascal!\\r , \\r , What books are these?  You\\'ve been a stealing \\'em, have you? Give \\'em\\r , here.\\'  With these words, the man tore the volumes from his grasp, and\\r , struck him on the head.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s right!\\' cried a looker-on, from a garret-window. \\'That\\'s the\\r , only way of bringing him to his senses!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'To be sure!\\' cried a sleepy-faced carpenter, casting an approving look\\r , at the garret-window.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'ll do him good!\\' said the two women.\\r , \\r , \\'And he shall have it, too!\\' rejoined the man, administering another\\r , blow, and seizing Oliver by the collar.  \\'Come on, you young villain!\\r , Here, Bull\\'s-eye, mind him, boy!  Mind him!\\'\\r , \\r , Weak with recent illness; stupified by the blows and the suddenness of\\r , the attack; terrified by the fierce growling of the dog, and the\\r , brutality of the man; overpowered by the conviction of the bystanders\\r , that he really was the hardened little wretch he was described to be;\\r , what could one poor child do!  Darkness had set in; it was a low\\r , neighborhood; no help was near; resistance was useless.  In another\\r , moment he was dragged into a labyrinth of dark narrow courts, and was\\r , forced along them at a pace which rendered the few cries he dared to\\r , give utterance to, unintelligible.  It was of little moment, indeed,\\r , whether they were intelligible or no; for there was nobody to care for\\r , them, had they been ever so plain.\\r , \\r , \\r ,       *      *      *      *      *\\r , \\r , The gas-lamps were lighted; Mrs. Bedwin was waiting anxiously at the\\r , open door; the servant had run up the street twenty times to see if\\r , there were any traces of Oliver; and still the two old gentlemen sat,\\r , perseveringly, in the dark parlour, with the watch between them.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XVI\\r , \\r , RELATES WHAT BECAME OF OLIVER TWIST, AFTER HE HAD BEEN CLAIMED BY NANCY\\r , \\r , The narrow streets and courts, at length, terminated in a large open\\r , space; scattered about which, were pens for beasts, and other\\r , indications of a cattle-market.  Sikes slackened his pace when they\\r , reached this spot:  the girl being quite unable to support any longer,\\r , the rapid rate at which they had hitherto walked.  Turning to Oliver,\\r , he roughly commanded him to take hold of Nancy\\'s hand.\\r , \\r , \\'Do you hear?\\' growled Sikes, as Oliver hesitated, and looked round.\\r , \\r , They were in a dark corner, quite out of the track of passengers.\\r , \\r , Oliver saw, but too plainly, that resistance would be of no avail.  He\\r , held out his hand, which Nancy clasped tight in hers.\\r , \\r , \\'Give me the other,\\' said Sikes, seizing Oliver\\'s unoccupied hand.\\r , \\'Here, Bull\\'s-Eye!\\'\\r , \\r , The dog looked up, and growled.\\r , \\r , \\'See here, boy!\\' said Sikes, putting his other hand to Oliver\\'s throat;\\r , \\'if he speaks ever so soft a word, hold him!  D\\'ye mind!\\'\\r , \\r , The dog growled again; and licking his lips, eyed Oliver as if he were\\r , anxious to attach himself to his windpipe without delay.\\r , \\r , \\'He\\'s as willing as a Christian, strike me blind if he isn\\'t!\\' said\\r , Sikes, regarding the animal with a kind of grim and ferocious approval.\\r , \\'Now, you know what you\\'ve got to expect, master, so call away as quick\\r , as you like; the dog will soon stop that game.  Get on, young\\'un!\\'\\r , \\r , Bull\\'s-eye wagged his tail in acknowledgment of this unusually\\r , endearing form of speech; and, giving vent to another admonitory growl\\r , for the benefit of Oliver, led the way onward.\\r , \\r , It was Smithfield that they were crossing, although it might have been\\r , Grosvenor Square, for anything Oliver knew to the contrary. The night\\r , was dark and foggy.  The lights in the shops could scarecely struggle\\r , through the heavy mist, which thickened every moment and shrouded the\\r , streets and houses in gloom; rendering the strange place still stranger\\r , in Oliver\\'s eyes; and making his uncertainty the more dismal and\\r , depressing.\\r , \\r , They had hurried on a few paces, when a deep church-bell struck the\\r , hour.  With its first stroke, his two conductors stopped, and turned\\r , their heads in the direction whence the sound proceeded.\\r , \\r , \\'Eight o\\' clock, Bill,\\' said Nancy, when the bell ceased.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s the good of telling me that; I can hear it, can\\'t I!\\' replied\\r , Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'I wonder whether THEY can hear it,\\' said Nancy.\\r , \\r , \\'Of course they can,\\' replied Sikes.  \\'It was Bartlemy time when I was\\r , shopped; and there warn\\'t a penny trumpet in the fair, as I couldn\\'t\\r , hear the squeaking on.  Arter I was locked up for the night, the row\\r , and din outside made the thundering old jail so silent, that I could\\r , almost have beat my brains out against the iron plates of the door.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Poor fellow!\\' said Nancy, who still had her face turned towards the\\r , quarter in which the bell had sounded.  \\'Oh, Bill, such fine young\\r , chaps as them!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes; that\\'s all you women think of,\\' answered Sikes.  \\'Fine young\\r , chaps!  Well, they\\'re as good as dead, so it don\\'t much matter.\\'\\r , \\r , With this consolation, Mr. Sikes appeared to repress a rising tendency\\r , to jealousy, and, clasping Oliver\\'s wrist more firmly, told him to step\\r , out again.\\r , \\r , \\'Wait a minute!\\' said the girl:  \\'I wouldn\\'t hurry by, if it was you\\r , that was coming out to be hung, the next time eight o\\'clock struck,\\r , Bill.  I\\'d walk round and round the place till I dropped, if the snow\\r , was on the ground, and I hadn\\'t a shawl to cover me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And what good would that do?\\' inquired the unsentimental Mr. Sikes.\\r , \\'Unless you could pitch over a file and twenty yards of good stout\\r , rope, you might as well be walking fifty mile off, or not walking at\\r , all, for all the good it would do me.  Come on, and don\\'t stand\\r , preaching there.\\'\\r , \\r , The girl burst into a laugh; drew her shawl more closely round her; and\\r , they walked away.  But Oliver felt her hand tremble, and, looking up in\\r , her face as they passed a gas-lamp, saw that it had turned a deadly\\r , white.\\r , \\r , They walked on, by little-frequented and dirty ways, for a full\\r , half-hour:  meeting very few people, and those appearing from their\\r , looks to hold much the same position in society as Mr. Sikes himself.\\r , At length they turned into a very filthy narrow street, nearly full of\\r , old-clothes shops; the dog running forward, as if conscious that there\\r , was no further occasion for his keeping on guard, stopped before the\\r , door of a shop that was closed and apparently untenanted; the house was\\r , in a ruinous condition, and on the door was nailed a board, intimating\\r , that it was to let:  which looked as if it had hung there for many\\r , years.\\r , \\r , \\'All right,\\' cried Sikes, glancing cautiously about.\\r , \\r , Nancy stooped below the shutters, and Oliver heard the sound of a bell.\\r , They crossed to the opposite side of the street, and stood for a few\\r , moments under a lamp.  A noise, as if a sash window were gently raised,\\r , was heard; and soon afterwards the door softly opened.  Mr. Sikes then\\r , seized the terrified boy by the collar with very little ceremony; and\\r , all three were quickly inside the house.\\r , \\r , The passage was perfectly dark.  They waited, while the person who had\\r , let them in, chained and barred the door.\\r , \\r , \\'Anybody here?\\' inquired Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' replied a voice, which Oliver thought he had heard before.\\r , \\r , \\'Is the old \\'un here?\\' asked the robber.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' replied the voice, \\'and precious down in the mouth he has been.\\r , Won\\'t he be glad to see you?  Oh, no!\\'\\r , \\r , The style of this reply, as well as the voice which delivered it,\\r , seemed familiar to Oliver\\'s ears:  but it was impossible to distinguish\\r , even the form of the speaker in the darkness.\\r , \\r , \\'Let\\'s have a glim,\\' said Sikes, \\'or we shall go breaking our necks, or\\r , treading on the dog.  Look after your legs if you do!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Stand still a moment, and I\\'ll get you one,\\' replied the voice. The\\r , receding footsteps of the speaker were heard; and, in another minute,\\r , the form of Mr. John Dawkins, otherwise the Artful Dodger, appeared.\\r , He bore in his right hand a tallow candle stuck in the end of a cleft\\r , stick.\\r , \\r , The young gentleman did not stop to bestow any other mark of\\r , recognition upon Oliver than a humourous grin; but, turning away,\\r , beckoned the visitors to follow him down a flight of stairs. They\\r , crossed an empty kitchen; and, opening the door of a low\\r , earthy-smelling room, which seemed to have been built in a small\\r , back-yard, were received with a shout of laughter.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, my wig, my wig!\\' cried Master Charles Bates, from whose lungs the\\r , laughter had proceeded:  \\'here he is! oh, cry, here he is!  Oh, Fagin,\\r , look at him!  Fagin, do look at him! I can\\'t bear it; it is such a\\r , jolly game, I cant\\' bear it.  Hold me, somebody, while I laugh it out.\\'\\r , \\r , With this irrepressible ebullition of mirth, Master Bates laid himself\\r , flat on the floor: and kicked convulsively for five minutes, in an\\r , ectasy of facetious joy.  Then jumping to his feet, he snatched the\\r , cleft stick from the Dodger; and, advancing to Oliver, viewed him round\\r , and round; while the Jew, taking off his nightcap, made a great number\\r , of low bows to the bewildered boy.  The Artful, meantime, who was of a\\r , rather saturnine disposition, and seldom gave way to merriment when it\\r , interfered with business, rifled Oliver\\'s pockets with steady assiduity.\\r , \\r , \\'Look at his togs, Fagin!\\' said Charley, putting the light so close to\\r , his new jacket as nearly to set him on fire.  \\'Look at his togs!\\r , Superfine cloth, and the heavy swell cut!  Oh, my eye, what a game!\\r , And his books, too!  Nothing but a gentleman, Fagin!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Delighted to see you looking so well, my dear,\\' said the Jew, bowing\\r , with mock humility.  \\'The Artful shall give you another suit, my dear,\\r , for fear you should spoil that Sunday one.  Why didn\\'t you write, my\\r , dear, and say you were coming?  We\\'d have got something warm for\\r , supper.\\'\\r , \\r , At his, Master Bates roared again: so loud, that Fagin himself relaxed,\\r , and even the Dodger smiled; but as the Artful drew forth the five-pound\\r , note at that instant, it is doubtful whether the sally of the discovery\\r , awakened his merriment.\\r , \\r , \\'Hallo, what\\'s that?\\' inquired Sikes, stepping forward as the Jew\\r , seized the note.  \\'That\\'s mine, Fagin.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, no, my dear,\\' said the Jew.  \\'Mine, Bill, mine.  You shall have\\r , the books.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If that ain\\'t mine!\\' said Bill Sikes, putting on his hat with a\\r , determined air; \\'mine and Nancy\\'s that is; I\\'ll take the boy back\\r , again.\\'\\r , \\r , The Jew started.  Oliver started too, though from a very different\\r , cause; for he hoped that the dispute might really end in his being\\r , taken back.\\r , \\r , \\'Come!  Hand over, will you?\\' said Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'This is hardly fair, Bill; hardly fair, is it, Nancy?\\' inquired the\\r , Jew.\\r , \\r , \\'Fair, or not fair,\\' retorted Sikes, \\'hand over, I tell you! Do you\\r , think Nancy and me has got nothing else to do with our precious time\\r , but to spend it in scouting arter, and kidnapping, every young boy as\\r , gets grabbed through you?  Give it here, you avaricious old skeleton,\\r , give it here!\\'\\r , \\r , With this gentle remonstrance, Mr. Sikes plucked the note from between\\r , the Jew\\'s finger and thumb; and looking the old man coolly in the face,\\r , folded it up small, and tied it in his neckerchief.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s for our share of the trouble,\\' said Sikes; \\'and not half\\r , enough, neither.  You may keep the books, if you\\'re fond of reading.\\r , If you ain\\'t, sell \\'em.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'They\\'re very pretty,\\' said Charley Bates: who, with sundry grimaces,\\r , had been affecting to read one of the volumes in question; \\'beautiful\\r , writing, isn\\'t is, Oliver?\\'  At sight of the dismayed look with which\\r , Oliver regarded his tormentors, Master Bates, who was blessed with a\\r , lively sense of the ludicrous, fell into another ectasy, more\\r , boisterous than the first.\\r , \\r , \\'They belong to the old gentleman,\\' said Oliver, wringing his hands;\\r , \\'to the good, kind, old gentleman who took me into his house, and had\\r , me nursed, when I was near dying of the fever. Oh, pray send them back;\\r , send him back the books and money.  Keep me here all my life long; but\\r , pray, pray send them back.  He\\'ll think I stole them; the old lady:\\r , all of them who were so kind to me: will think I stole them.  Oh, do\\r , have mercy upon me, and send them back!\\'\\r , \\r , With these words, which were uttered with all the energy of passionate\\r , grief, Oliver fell upon his knees at the Jew\\'s feet; and beat his hands\\r , together, in perfect desperation.\\r , \\r , \\'The boy\\'s right,\\' remarked Fagin, looking covertly round, and knitting\\r , his shaggy eyebrows into a hard knot.  \\'You\\'re right, Oliver, you\\'re\\r , right; they WILL think you have stolen \\'em.  Ha! ha!\\' chuckled the Jew,\\r , rubbing his hands, \\'it couldn\\'t have happened better, if we had chosen\\r , our time!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Of course it couldn\\'t,\\' replied Sikes; \\'I know\\'d that, directly I see\\r , him coming through Clerkenwell, with the books under his arm.  It\\'s all\\r , right enough.  They\\'re soft-hearted psalm-singers, or they wouldn\\'t\\r , have taken him in at all; and they\\'ll ask no questions after him, fear\\r , they should be obliged to prosecute, and so get him lagged.  He\\'s safe\\r , enough.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver had looked from one to the other, while these words were being\\r , spoken, as if he were bewildered, and could scarecely understand what\\r , passed; but when Bill Sikes concluded, he jumped suddenly to his feet,\\r , and tore wildly from the room:  uttering shrieks for help, which made\\r , the bare old house echo to the roof.\\r , \\r , \\'Keep back the dog, Bill!\\' cried Nancy, springing before the door, and\\r , closing it, as the Jew and his two pupils darted out in pursuit.  \\'Keep\\r , back the dog; he\\'ll tear the boy to pieces.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Serve him right!\\' cried Sikes, struggling to disengage himself from\\r , the girl\\'s grasp.  \\'Stand off from me, or I\\'ll split your head against\\r , the wall.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t care for that, Bill, I don\\'t care for that,\\' screamed the\\r , girl, struggling violently with the man, \\'the child shan\\'t be torn down\\r , by the dog, unless you kill me first.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Shan\\'t he!\\' said Sikes, setting his teeth.  \\'I\\'ll soon do that, if you\\r , don\\'t keep off.\\'\\r , \\r , The housebreaker flung the girl from him to the further end of the\\r , room, just as the Jew and the two boys returned, dragging Oliver among\\r , them.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s the matter here!\\' said Fagin, looking round.\\r , \\r , \\'The girl\\'s gone mad, I think,\\' replied Sikes, savagely.\\r , \\r , \\'No, she hasn\\'t,\\' said Nancy, pale and breathless from the scuffle;\\r , \\'no, she hasn\\'t, Fagin; don\\'t think it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then keep quiet, will you?\\' said the Jew, with a threatening look.\\r , \\r , \\'No, I won\\'t do that, neither,\\' replied Nancy, speaking very loud.\\r , \\'Come!  What do you think of that?\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Fagin was sufficiently well acquainted with the manners and customs\\r , of that particular species of humanity to which Nancy belonged, to feel\\r , tolerably certain that it would be rather unsafe to prolong any\\r , conversation with her, at present.  With the view of diverting the\\r , attention of the company, he turned to Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'So you wanted to get away, my dear, did you?\\' said the Jew, taking up\\r , a jagged and knotted club which law in a corner of the fireplace; \\'eh?\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver made no reply.  But he watched the Jew\\'s motions, and breathed\\r , quickly.\\r , \\r , \\'Wanted to get assistance; called for the police; did you?\\' sneered the\\r , Jew, catching the boy by the arm.  \\'We\\'ll cure you of that, my young\\r , master.\\'\\r , \\r , The Jew inflicted a smart blow on Oliver\\'s shoulders with the club; and\\r , was raising it for a second, when the girl, rushing forward, wrested it\\r , from his hand.  She flung it into the fire, with a force that brought\\r , some of the glowing coals whirling out into the room.\\r , \\r , \\'I won\\'t stand by and see it done, Fagin,\\' cried the girl. \\'You\\'ve got\\r , the boy, and what more would you have?--Let him be--let him be--or I\\r , shall put that mark on some of you, that will bring me to the gallows\\r , before my time.\\'\\r , \\r , The girl stamped her foot violently on the floor as she vented this\\r , threat; and with her lips compressed, and her hands clenched, looked\\r , alternately at the Jew and the other robber: her face quite colourless\\r , from the passion of rage into which she had gradually worked herself.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, Nancy!\\' said the Jew, in a soothing tone; after a pause, during\\r , which he and Mr. Sikes had stared at one another in a disconcerted\\r , manner; \\'you,--you\\'re more clever than ever to-night.  Ha! ha! my dear,\\r , you are acting beautifully.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Am I!\\' said the girl.  \\'Take care I don\\'t overdo it.  You will be the\\r , worse for it, Fagin, if I do; and so I tell you in good time to keep\\r , clear of me.\\'\\r , \\r , There is something about a roused woman: especially if she add to all\\r , her other strong passions, the fierce impulses of recklessness and\\r , despair; which few men like to provoke. The Jew saw that it would be\\r , hopeless to affect any further mistake regarding the reality of Miss\\r , Nancy\\'s rage; and, shrinking involuntarily back a few paces, cast a\\r , glance, half imploring and half cowardly, at Sikes: as if to hint that\\r , he was the fittest person to pursue the dialogue.\\r , \\r , Mr. Sikes, thus mutely appealed to; and possibly feeling his personal\\r , pride and influence interested in the immediate reduction of Miss Nancy\\r , to reason; gave utterance to about a couple of score of curses and\\r , threats, the rapid production of which reflected great credit on the\\r , fertility of his invention. As they produced no visible effect on the\\r , object against whom they were discharged, however, he resorted to more\\r , tangible arguments.\\r , \\r , \\'What do you mean by this?\\' said Sikes; backing the inquiry with a very\\r , common imprecation concerning the most beautiful of human features:\\r , which, if it were heard above, only once out of every fifty thousand\\r , times that it is uttered below, would render blindness as common a\\r , disorder as measles: \\'what do you mean by it?  Burn my body!  Do you\\r , know who you are, and what you are?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, yes, I know all about it,\\' replied the girl, laughing\\r , hysterically; and shaking her head from side to side, with a poor\\r , assumption of indifference.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, then, keep quiet,\\' rejoined Sikes, with a growl like that he was\\r , accustomed to use when addressing his dog, \\'or I\\'ll quiet you for a\\r , good long time to come.\\'\\r , \\r , The girl laughed again: even less composedly than before; and, darting\\r , a hasty look at Sikes, turned her face aside, and bit her lip till the\\r , blood came.\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'re a nice one,\\' added Sikes, as he surveyed her with a\\r , contemptuous air, \\'to take up the humane and gen--teel side!  A pretty\\r , subject for the child, as you call him, to make a friend of!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'God Almighty help me, I am!\\' cried the girl passionately; \\'and I wish\\r , I had been struck dead in the street, or had changed places with them\\r , we passed so near to-night, before I had lent a hand in bringing him\\r , here.  He\\'s a thief, a liar, a devil, all that\\'s bad, from this night\\r , forth.  Isn\\'t that enough for the old wretch, without blows?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Come, come, Sikes,\\' said the Jew appealing to him in a remonstratory\\r , tone, and motioning towards the boys, who were eagerly attentive to all\\r , that passed; \\'we must have civil words; civil words, Bill.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Civil words!\\' cried the girl, whose passion was frightful to see.\\r , \\'Civil words, you villain!  Yes, you deserve \\'em from me. I thieved for\\r , you when I was a child not half as old as this!\\' pointing to Oliver.\\r , \\'I have been in the same trade, and in the same service, for twelve\\r , years since.  Don\\'t you know it?  Speak out!  Don\\'t you know it?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, well,\\' replied the Jew, with an attempt at pacification; \\'and,\\r , if you have, it\\'s your living!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Aye, it is!\\' returned the girl; not speaking, but pouring out the\\r , words in one continuous and vehement scream.  \\'It is my living; and the\\r , cold, wet, dirty streets are my home; and you\\'re the wretch that drove\\r , me to them long ago, and that\\'ll keep me there, day and night, day and\\r , night, till I die!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I shall do you a mischief!\\' interposed the Jew, goaded by these\\r , reproaches; \\'a mischief worse than that, if you say much more!\\'\\r , \\r , The girl said nothing more; but, tearing her hair and dress in a\\r , transport of passion, made such a rush at the Jew as would probably\\r , have left signal marks of her revenge upon him, had not her wrists been\\r , seized by Sikes at the right moment; upon which, she made a few\\r , ineffectual struggles, and fainted.\\r , \\r , \\'She\\'s all right now,\\' said Sikes, laying her down in a corner. \\'She\\'s\\r , uncommon strong in the arms, when she\\'s up in this way.\\'\\r , \\r , The Jew wiped his forehead: and smiled, as if it were a relief to have\\r , the disturbance over; but neither he, nor Sikes, nor the dog, nor the\\r , boys, seemed to consider it in any other light than a common occurance\\r , incidental to business.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s the worst of having to do with women,\\' said the Jew, replacing\\r , his club; \\'but they\\'re clever, and we can\\'t get on, in our line,\\r , without \\'em.  Charley, show Oliver to bed.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I suppose he\\'d better not wear his best clothes tomorrow, Fagin, had\\r , he?\\' inquired Charley Bates.\\r , \\r , \\'Certainly not,\\' replied the Jew, reciprocating the grin with which\\r , Charley put the question.\\r , \\r , Master Bates, apparently much delighted with his commission, took the\\r , cleft stick: and led Oliver into an adjacent kitchen, where there were\\r , two or three of the beds on which he had slept before; and here, with\\r , many uncontrollable bursts of laughter, he produced the identical old\\r , suit of clothes which Oliver had so much congratulated himself upon\\r , leaving off at Mr. Brownlow\\'s; and the accidental display of which, to\\r , Fagin, by the Jew who purchased them, had been the very first clue\\r , received, of his whereabout.\\r , \\r , \\'Put off the smart ones,\\' said Charley, \\'and I\\'ll give \\'em to Fagin to\\r , take care of.  What fun it is!\\'\\r , \\r , Poor Oliver unwillingly complied.  Master Bates rolling up the new\\r , clothes under his arm, departed from the room, leaving Oliver in the\\r , dark, and locking the door behind him.\\r , \\r , The noise of Charley\\'s laughter, and the voice of Miss Betsy, who\\r , opportunely arrived to throw water over her friend, and perform other\\r , feminine offices for the promotion of her recovery, might have kept\\r , many people awake under more happy circumstances than those in which\\r , Oliver was placed.  But he was sick and weary; and he soon fell sound\\r , asleep.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XVII\\r , \\r , OLIVER\\'S DESTINY CONTINUING UNPROPITIOUS, BRINGS A GREAT MAN TO LONDON\\r , TO INJURE HIS REPUTATION\\r , \\r , It is the custom on the stage, in all good murderous melodramas, to\\r , present the tragic and the comic scenes, in as regular alternation, as\\r , the layers of red and white in a side of streaky bacon.  The hero sinks\\r , upon his straw bed, weighed down by fetters and misfortunes; in the\\r , next scene, his faithful but unconscious squire regales the audience\\r , with a comic song.  We behold, with throbbing bosoms, the heroine in\\r , the grasp of a proud and ruthless baron: her virtue and her life alike\\r , in danger, drawing forth her dagger to preserve the one at the cost of\\r , the other; and just as our expectations are wrought up to the highest\\r , pitch, a whistle is heard, and we are straightway transported to the\\r , great hall of the castle; where a grey-headed seneschal sings a funny\\r , chorus with a funnier body of vassals, who are free of all sorts of\\r , places, from church vaults to palaces, and roam about in company,\\r , carolling perpetually.\\r , \\r , Such changes appear absurd; but they are not so unnatural as they would\\r , seem at first sight.  The transitions in real life from well-spread\\r , boards to death-beds, and from mourning-weeds to holiday garments, are\\r , not a whit less startling; only, there, we are busy actors, instead of\\r , passive lookers-on, which makes a vast difference.  The actors in the\\r , mimic life of the theatre, are blind to violent transitions and abrupt\\r , impulses of passion or feeling, which, presented before the eyes of\\r , mere spectators, are at once condemned as outrageous and preposterous.\\r , \\r , As sudden shiftings of the scene, and rapid changes of time and place,\\r , are not only sanctioned in books by long usage, but are by many\\r , considered as the great art of authorship: an author\\'s skill in his\\r , craft being, by such critics, chiefly estimated with relation to the\\r , dilemmas in which he leaves his characters at the end of every chapter:\\r , this brief introduction to the present one may perhaps be deemed\\r , unnecessary.  If so, let it be considered a delicate intimation on the\\r , part of the historian that he is going back to the town in which Oliver\\r , Twist was born; the reader taking it for granted that there are good\\r , and substantial reasons for making the journey, or he would not be\\r , invited to proceed upon such an expedition.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble emerged at early morning from the workhouse-gate, and walked\\r , with portly carriage and commanding steps, up the High Street.  He was\\r , in the full bloom and pride of beadlehood; his cocked hat and coat were\\r , dazzling in the morning sun; he clutched his cane with the vigorous\\r , tenacity of health and power.  Mr. Bumble always carried his head high;\\r , but this morning it was higher than usual.  There was an abstraction in\\r , his eye, an elevation in his air, which might have warned an observant\\r , stranger that thoughts were passing in the beadle\\'s mind, too great for\\r , utterance.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble stopped not to converse with the small shopkeepers and\\r , others who spoke to him, deferentially, as he passed along.  He merely\\r , returned their salutations with a wave of his hand, and relaxed not in\\r , his dignified pace, until he reached the farm where Mrs. Mann tended\\r , the infant paupers with parochial care.\\r , \\r , \\'Drat that beadle!\\' said Mrs. Mann, hearing the well-known shaking at\\r , the garden-gate.  \\'If it isn\\'t him at this time in the morning!  Lauk,\\r , Mr. Bumble, only think of its being you!  Well, dear me, it IS a\\r , pleasure, this is!  Come into the parlour, sir, please.\\'\\r , \\r , The first sentence was addressed to Susan; and the exclamations of\\r , delight were uttered to Mr. Bumble: as the good lady unlocked the\\r , garden-gate: and showed him, with great attention and respect, into the\\r , house.\\r , \\r , \\'Mrs. Mann,\\' said Mr. Bumble; not sitting upon, or dropping himself\\r , into a seat, as any common jackanapes would: but letting himself\\r , gradually and slowly down into a chair; \\'Mrs. Mann, ma\\'am, good\\r , morning.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, and good morning to _you_, sir,\\' replied Mrs. Mann, with many\\r , smiles; \\'and hoping you find yourself well, sir!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'So-so, Mrs. Mann,\\' replied the beadle.  \\'A porochial life is not a bed\\r , of roses, Mrs. Mann.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah, that it isn\\'t indeed, Mr. Bumble,\\' rejoined the lady. And all the\\r , infant paupers might have chorussed the rejoinder with great propriety,\\r , if they had heard it.\\r , \\r , \\'A porochial life, ma\\'am,\\' continued Mr. Bumble, striking the table\\r , with his cane, \\'is a life of worrit, and vexation, and hardihood; but\\r , all public characters, as I may say, must suffer prosecution.\\'\\r , \\r , Mrs. Mann, not very well knowing what the beadle meant, raised her\\r , hands with a look of sympathy, and sighed.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!  You may well sigh, Mrs. Mann!\\' said the beadle.\\r , \\r , Finding she had done right, Mrs. Mann sighed again:  evidently to the\\r , satisfaction of the public character:  who, repressing a complacent\\r , smile by looking sternly at his cocked hat, said,\\r , \\r , \\'Mrs. Mann, I am going to London.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Lauk, Mr. Bumble!\\' cried Mrs. Mann, starting back.\\r , \\r , \\'To London, ma\\'am,\\' resumed the inflexible beadle, \\'by coach.  I and\\r , two paupers, Mrs. Mann!  A legal action is a coming on, about a\\r , settlement; and the board has appointed me--me, Mrs. Mann--to dispose\\r , to the matter before the quarter-sessions at Clerkinwell.\\r , \\r , And I very much question,\\' added Mr. Bumble, drawing himself up,\\r , \\'whether the Clerkinwell Sessions will not find themselves in the wrong\\r , box before they have done with me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh! you mustn\\'t be too hard upon them, sir,\\' said Mrs. Mann, coaxingly.\\r , \\r , \\'The Clerkinwell Sessions have brought it upon themselves, ma\\'am,\\'\\r , replied Mr. Bumble; \\'and if the Clerkinwell Sessions find that they\\r , come off rather worse than they expected, the Clerkinwell Sessions have\\r , only themselves to thank.\\'\\r , \\r , There was so much determination and depth of purpose about the menacing\\r , manner in which Mr. Bumble delivered himself of these words, that Mrs.\\r , Mann appeared quite awed by them. At length she said,\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'re going by coach, sir?  I thought it was always usual to send\\r , them paupers in carts.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s when they\\'re ill, Mrs. Mann,\\' said the beadle.  \\'We put the\\r , sick paupers into open carts in the rainy weather, to prevent their\\r , taking cold.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh!\\' said Mrs. Mann.\\r , \\r , \\'The opposition coach contracts for these two; and takes them cheap,\\'\\r , said Mr. Bumble.  \\'They are both in a very low state, and we find it\\r , would come two pound cheaper to move \\'em than to bury \\'em--that is, if\\r , we can throw \\'em upon another parish, which I think we shall be able to\\r , do, if they don\\'t die upon the road to spite us.  Ha! ha! ha!\\'\\r , \\r , When Mr. Bumble had laughed a little while, his eyes again encountered\\r , the cocked hat; and he became grave.\\r , \\r , \\'We are forgetting business, ma\\'am,\\' said the beadle; \\'here is your\\r , porochial stipend for the month.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble produced some silver money rolled up in paper, from his\\r , pocket-book; and requested a receipt:  which Mrs. Mann wrote.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s very much blotted, sir,\\' said the farmer of infants; \\'but it\\'s\\r , formal enough, I dare say.  Thank you, Mr. Bumble, sir, I am very much\\r , obliged to you, I\\'m sure.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble nodded, blandly, in acknowledgment of Mrs. Mann\\'s curtsey;\\r , and inquired how the children were.\\r , \\r , \\'Bless their dear little hearts!\\' said Mrs. Mann with emotion, \\'they\\'re\\r , as well as can be, the dears!  Of course, except the two that died last\\r , week.  And little Dick.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Isn\\'t that boy no better?\\' inquired Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , Mrs. Mann shook her head.\\r , \\r , \\'He\\'s a ill-conditioned, wicious, bad-disposed porochial child that,\\'\\r , said Mr. Bumble angrily.  \\'Where is he?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ll bring him to you in one minute, sir,\\' replied Mrs. Mann. \\'Here,\\r , you Dick!\\'\\r , \\r , After some calling, Dick was discovered.  Having had his face put under\\r , the pump, and dried upon Mrs. Mann\\'s gown, he was led into the awful\\r , presence of Mr. Bumble, the beadle.\\r , \\r , The child was pale and thin; his cheeks were sunken; and his eyes large\\r , and bright.  The scanty parish dress, the livery of his misery, hung\\r , loosely on his feeble body; and his young limbs had wasted away, like\\r , those of an old man.\\r , \\r , Such was the little being who stood trembling beneath Mr. Bumble\\'s\\r , glance; not daring to lift his eyes from the floor; and dreading even\\r , to hear the beadle\\'s voice.\\r , \\r , \\'Can\\'t you look at the gentleman, you obstinate boy?\\' said Mrs. Mann.\\r , \\r , The child meekly raised his eyes, and encountered those of Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s the matter with you, porochial Dick?\\' inquired Mr. Bumble, with\\r , well-timed jocularity.\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing, sir,\\' replied the child faintly.\\r , \\r , \\'I should think not,\\' said Mrs. Mann, who had of course laughed very\\r , much at Mr. Bumble\\'s humour.\\r , \\r , \\'You want for nothing, I\\'m sure.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I should like--\\' faltered the child.\\r , \\r , \\'Hey-day!\\' interposed Mr. Mann, \\'I suppose you\\'re going to say that you\\r , DO want for something, now?  Why, you little wretch--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Stop, Mrs. Mann, stop!\\' said the beadle, raising his hand with a show\\r , of authority.  \\'Like what, sir, eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I should like,\\' faltered the child, \\'if somebody that can write, would\\r , put a few words down for me on a piece of paper, and fold it up and\\r , seal it, and keep it for me, after I am laid in the ground.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why, what does the boy mean?\\' exclaimed Mr. Bumble, on whom the\\r , earnest manner and wan aspect of the child had made some impression:\\r , accustomed as he was to such things.  \\'What do you mean, sir?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I should like,\\' said the child, \\'to leave my dear love to poor Oliver\\r , Twist; and to let him know how often I have sat by myself and cried to\\r , think of his wandering about in the dark nights with nobody to help\\r , him.  And I should like to tell him,\\' said the child pressing his small\\r , hands together, and speaking with great fervour, \\'that I was glad to\\r , die when I was very young; for, perhaps, if I had lived to be a man,\\r , and had grown old, my little sister who is in Heaven, might forget me,\\r , or be unlike me; and it would be so much happier if we were both\\r , children there together.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble surveyed the little speaker, from head to foot, with\\r , indescribable astonishment; and, turning to his companion, said,\\r , \\'They\\'re all in one story, Mrs. Mann.  That out-dacious Oliver had\\r , demogalized them all!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I couldn\\'t have believed it, sir\\' said Mrs Mann, holding up her hands,\\r , and looking malignantly at Dick.  \\'I never see such a hardened little\\r , wretch!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Take him away, ma\\'am!\\' said Mr. Bumble imperiously.  \\'This must be\\r , stated to the board, Mrs. Mann.\\r , \\r , \\'I hope the gentleman will understand that it isn\\'t my fault, sir?\\'\\r , said Mrs. Mann, whimpering pathetically.\\r , \\r , \\'They shall understand that, ma\\'am; they shall be acquainted with the\\r , true state of the case,\\' said Mr. Bumble.  \\'There; take him away, I\\r , can\\'t bear the sight on him.\\'\\r , \\r , Dick was immediately taken away, and locked up in the coal-cellar.  Mr.\\r , Bumble shortly afterwards took himself off, to prepare for his journey.\\r , \\r , At six o\\'clock next morning, Mr. Bumble:  having exchanged his cocked\\r , hat for a round one, and encased his person in a blue great-coat with a\\r , cape to it:  took his place on the outside of the coach, accompanied by\\r , the criminals whose settlement was disputed; with whom, in due course\\r , of time, he arrived in London.\\r , \\r , He experienced no other crosses on the way, than those which originated\\r , in the perverse behaviour of the two paupers, who persisted in\\r , shivering, and complaining of the cold, in a manner which, Mr. Bumble\\r , declared, caused his teeth to chatter in his head, and made him feel\\r , quite uncomfortable; although he had a great-coat on.\\r , \\r , Having disposed of these evil-minded persons for the night, Mr. Bumble\\r , sat himself down in the house at which the coach stopped; and took a\\r , temperate dinner of steaks, oyster sauce, and porter. Putting a glass\\r , of hot gin-and-water on the chimney-piece, he drew his chair to the\\r , fire; and, with sundry moral reflections on the too-prevalent sin of\\r , discontent and complaining, composed himself to read the paper.\\r , \\r , The very first paragraph upon which Mr. Bumble\\'s eye rested, was the\\r , following advertisement.\\r , \\r ,                  \\'FIVE GUINEAS REWARD\\r , \\r , \\'Whereas a young boy, named Oliver Twist, absconded, or was enticed, on\\r , Thursday evening last, from his home, at Pentonville; and has not since\\r , been heard of.  The above reward will be paid to any person who will\\r , give such information as will lead to the discovery of the said Oliver\\r , Twist, or tend to throw any light upon his previous history, in which\\r , the advertiser is, for many reasons, warmly interested.\\'\\r , \\r , And then followed a full description of Oliver\\'s dress, person,\\r , appearance, and disappearance:  with the name and address of Mr.\\r , Brownlow at full length.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble opened his eyes; read the advertisement, slowly and\\r , carefully, three several times; and in something more than five minutes\\r , was on his way to Pentonville: having actually, in his excitement, left\\r , the glass of hot gin-and-water, untasted.\\r , \\r , \\'Is Mr. Brownlow at home?\\' inquired Mr. Bumble of the girl who opened\\r , the door.\\r , \\r , To this inquiry the girl returned the not uncommon, but rather evasive\\r , reply of \\'I don\\'t know; where do you come from?\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble no sooner uttered Oliver\\'s name, in explanation of his\\r , errand, than Mrs. Bedwin, who had been listening at the parlour door,\\r , hastened into the passage in a breathless state.\\r , \\r , \\'Come in, come in,\\' said the old lady: \\'I knew we should hear of him.\\r , Poor dear!  I knew we should!  I was certain of it.  Bless his heart!\\r , I said so all along.\\'\\r , \\r , Having heard this, the worthy old lady hurried back into the parlour\\r , again; and seating herself on a sofa, burst into tears. The girl, who\\r , was not quite so susceptible, had run upstairs meanwhile; and now\\r , returned with a request that Mr. Bumble would follow her immediately:\\r , which he did.\\r , \\r , He was shown into the little back study, where sat Mr. Brownlow and his\\r , friend Mr. Grimwig, with decanters and glasses before them.  The latter\\r , gentleman at once burst into the exclamation:\\r , \\r , \\'A beadle.  A parish beadle, or I\\'ll eat my head.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Pray don\\'t interrupt just now,\\' said Mr. Brownlow.  \\'Take a seat, will\\r , you?\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble sat himself down; quite confounded by the oddity of Mr.\\r , Grimwig\\'s manner.  Mr. Brownlow moved the lamp, so as to obtain an\\r , uninterrupted view of the beadle\\'s countenance; and said, with a little\\r , impatience,\\r , \\r , \\'Now, sir, you come in consequence of having seen the advertisement?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, sir,\\' said Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'And you ARE a beadle, are you not?\\' inquired Mr. Grimwig.\\r , \\r , \\'I am a porochial beadle, gentlemen,\\' rejoined Mr. Bumble proudly.\\r , \\r , \\'Of course,\\' observed Mr. Grimwig aside to his friend, \\'I knew he was.\\r , A beadle all over!\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Brownlow gently shook his head to impose silence on his friend, and\\r , resumed:\\r , \\r , \\'Do you know where this poor boy is now?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No more than nobody,\\' replied Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, what DO you know of him?\\' inquired the old gentleman. \\'Speak\\r , out, my friend, if you have anything to say.  What DO you know of him?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You don\\'t happen to know any good of him, do you?\\' said Mr. Grimwig,\\r , caustically; after an attentive perusal of Mr. Bumble\\'s features.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble, catching at the inquiry very quickly, shook his head with\\r , portentous solemnity.\\r , \\r , \\'You see?\\' said Mr. Grimwig, looking triumphantly at Mr. Brownlow.\\r , \\r , Mr. Brownlow looked apprehensively at Mr. Bumble\\'s pursed-up\\r , countenance; and requested him to communicate what he knew regarding\\r , Oliver, in as few words as possible.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble put down his hat; unbuttoned his coat; folded his arms;\\r , inclined his head in a retrospective manner; and, after a few moments\\'\\r , reflection, commenced his story.\\r , \\r , It would be tedious if given in the beadle\\'s words:  occupying, as it\\r , did, some twenty minutes in the telling; but the sum and substance of\\r , it was, that Oliver was a foundling, born of low and vicious parents.\\r , That he had, from his birth, displayed no better qualities than\\r , treachery, ingratitude, and malice.  That he had terminated his brief\\r , career in the place of his birth, by making a sanguinary and cowardly\\r , attack on an unoffending lad, and running away in the night-time from\\r , his master\\'s house.  In proof of his really being the person he\\r , represented himself, Mr. Bumble laid upon the table the papers he had\\r , brought to town. Folding his arms again, he then awaited Mr. Brownlow\\'s\\r , observations.\\r , \\r , \\'I fear it is all too true,\\' said the old gentleman sorrowfully, after\\r , looking over the papers.  \\'This is not much for your intelligence; but\\r , I would gladly have given you treble the money, if it had been\\r , favourable to the boy.\\'\\r , \\r , It is not improbable that if Mr. Bumble had been possessed of this\\r , information at an earlier period of the interview, he might have\\r , imparted a very different colouring to his little history. It was too\\r , late to do it now, however; so he shook his head gravely, and,\\r , pocketing the five guineas, withdrew.\\r , \\r , Mr. Brownlow paced the room to and fro for some minutes; evidently so\\r , much disturbed by the beadle\\'s tale, that even Mr. Grimwig forbore to\\r , vex him further.\\r , \\r , At length he stopped, and rang the bell violently.\\r , \\r , \\'Mrs. Bedwin,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, when the housekeeper appeared; \\'that\\r , boy, Oliver, is an imposter.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It can\\'t be, sir.  It cannot be,\\' said the old lady energetically.\\r , \\r , \\'I tell you he is,\\' retorted the old gentleman.  \\'What do you mean by\\r , can\\'t be?  We have just heard a full account of him from his birth; and\\r , he has been a thorough-paced little villain, all his life.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I never will believe it, sir,\\' replied the old lady, firmly. \\'Never!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You old women never believe anything but quack-doctors, and lying\\r , story-books,\\' growled Mr. Grimwig.  \\'I knew it all along. Why didn\\'t\\r , you take my advise in the beginning; you would if he hadn\\'t had a\\r , fever, I suppose, eh?  He was interesting, wasn\\'t he?  Interesting!\\r , Bah!\\'  And Mr. Grimwig poked the fire with a flourish.\\r , \\r , \\'He was a dear, grateful, gentle child, sir,\\' retorted Mrs. Bedwin,\\r , indignantly.  \\'I know what children are, sir; and have done these forty\\r , years; and people who can\\'t say the same, shouldn\\'t say anything about\\r , them.  That\\'s my opinion!\\'\\r , \\r , This was a hard hit at Mr. Grimwig, who was a bachelor.  As it extorted\\r , nothing from that gentleman but a smile, the old lady tossed her head,\\r , and smoothed down her apron preparatory to another speech, when she was\\r , stopped by Mr. Brownlow.\\r , \\r , \\'Silence!\\' said the old gentleman, feigning an anger he was far from\\r , feeling.  \\'Never let me hear the boy\\'s name again.  I rang to tell you\\r , that.  Never.  Never, on any pretence, mind!  You may leave the room,\\r , Mrs. Bedwin.  Remember!  I am in earnest.\\'\\r , \\r , There were sad hearts at Mr. Brownlow\\'s that night.\\r , \\r , Oliver\\'s heart sank within him, when he thought of his good friends; it\\r , was well for him that he could not know what they had heard, or it\\r , might have broken outright.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XVIII\\r , \\r , HOW OLIVER PASSED HIS TIME IN THE IMPROVING SOCIETY OF HIS REPUTABLE\\r , FRIENDS\\r , \\r , About noon next day, when the Dodger and Master Bates had gone out to\\r , pursue their customary avocations, Mr. Fagin took the opportunity of\\r , reading Oliver a long lecture on the crying sin of ingratitude; of\\r , which he clearly demonstrated he had been guilty, to no ordinary\\r , extent, in wilfully absenting himself from the society of his anxious\\r , friends; and, still more, in endeavouring to escape from them after so\\r , much trouble and expense had been incurred in his recovery. Mr. Fagin\\r , laid great stress on the fact of his having taken Oliver in, and\\r , cherished him, when, without his timely aid, he might have perished\\r , with hunger; and he related the dismal and affecting history of a young\\r , lad whom, in his philanthropy, he had succoured under parallel\\r , circumstances, but who, proving unworthy of his confidence and evincing\\r , a desire to communicate with the police, had unfortunately come to be\\r , hanged at the Old Bailey one morning.  Mr. Fagin did not seek to\\r , conceal his share in the catastrophe, but lamented with tears in his\\r , eyes that the wrong-headed and treacherous behaviour of the young\\r , person in question, had rendered it necessary that he should become the\\r , victim of certain evidence for the crown: which, if it were not\\r , precisely true, was indispensably necessary for the safety of him (Mr.\\r , Fagin) and a few select friends.  Mr. Fagin concluded by drawing a\\r , rather disagreeable picture of the discomforts of hanging; and, with\\r , great friendliness and politeness of manner, expressed his anxious\\r , hopes that he might never be obliged to submit Oliver Twist to that\\r , unpleasant operation.\\r , \\r , Little Oliver\\'s blood ran cold, as he listened to the Jew\\'s words, and\\r , imperfectly comprehended the dark threats conveyed in them.  That it\\r , was possible even for justice itself to confound the innocent with the\\r , guilty when they were in accidental companionship, he knew already; and\\r , that deeply-laid plans for the destruction of inconveniently knowing or\\r , over-communicative persons, had been really devised and carried out by\\r , the Jew on more occasions than one, he thought by no means unlikely,\\r , when he recollected the general nature of the altercations between that\\r , gentleman and Mr. Sikes: which seemed to bear reference to some\\r , foregone conspiracy of the kind.  As he glanced timidly up, and met the\\r , Jew\\'s searching look, he felt that his pale face and trembling limbs\\r , were neither unnoticed nor unrelished by that wary old gentleman.\\r , \\r , The Jew, smiling hideously, patted Oliver on the head, and said, that\\r , if he kept himself quiet, and applied himself to business, he saw they\\r , would be very good friends yet.  Then, taking his hat, and covering\\r , himself with an old patched great-coat, he went out, and locked the\\r , room-door behind him.\\r , \\r , And so Oliver remained all that day, and for the greater part of many\\r , subsequent days, seeing nobody, between early morning and midnight, and\\r , left during the long hours to commune with his own thoughts.  Which,\\r , never failing to revert to his kind friends, and the opinion they must\\r , long ago have formed of him, were sad indeed.\\r , \\r , After the lapse of a week or so, the Jew left the room-door unlocked;\\r , and he was at liberty to wander about the house.\\r , \\r , It was a very dirty place.  The rooms upstairs had great high wooden\\r , chimney-pieces and large doors, with panelled walls and cornices to the\\r , ceiling; which, although they were black with neglect and dust, were\\r , ornamented in various ways.  From all of these tokens Oliver concluded\\r , that a long time ago, before the old Jew was born, it had belonged to\\r , better people, and had perhaps been quite gay and handsome:  dismal and\\r , dreary as it looked now.\\r , \\r , Spiders had built their webs in the angles of the walls and ceilings;\\r , and sometimes, when Oliver walked softly into a room, the mice would\\r , scamper across the floor, and run back terrified to their holes.  With\\r , these exceptions, there was neither sight nor sound of any living\\r , thing; and often, when it grew dark, and he was tired of wandering from\\r , room to room, he would crouch in the corner of the passage by the\\r , street-door, to be as near living people as he could; and would remain\\r , there, listening and counting the hours, until the Jew or the boys\\r , returned.\\r , \\r , In all the rooms, the mouldering shutters were fast closed:  the bars\\r , which held them were screwed tight into the wood; the only light which\\r , was admitted, stealing its way through round holes at the top: which\\r , made the rooms more gloomy, and filled them with strange shadows.\\r , There was a back-garret window with rusty bars outside, which had no\\r , shutter; and out of this, Oliver often gazed with a melancholy face for\\r , hours together; but nothing was to be descried from it but a confused\\r , and crowded mass of housetops, blackened chimneys, and gable-ends.\\r , Sometimes, indeed, a grizzly head might be seen, peering over the\\r , parapet-wall of a distant house; but it was quickly withdrawn again;\\r , and as the window of Oliver\\'s observatory was nailed down, and dimmed\\r , with the rain and smoke of years, it was as much as he could do to make\\r , out the forms of the different objects beyond, without making any\\r , attempt to be seen or heard,--which he had as much chance of being, as\\r , if he had lived inside the ball of St. Paul\\'s Cathedral.\\r , \\r , One afternoon, the Dodger and Master Bates being engaged out that\\r , evening, the first-named young gentleman took it into his head to\\r , evince some anxiety regarding the decoration of his person (to do him\\r , justice, this was by no means an habitual weakness with him); and, with\\r , this end and aim, he condescendingly commanded Oliver to assist him in\\r , his toilet, straightway.\\r , \\r , Oliver was but too glad to make himself useful; too happy to have some\\r , faces, however bad, to look upon; too desirous to conciliate those\\r , about him when he could honestly do so; to throw any objection in the\\r , way of this proposal.  So he at once expressed his readiness; and,\\r , kneeling on the floor, while the Dodger sat upon the table so that he\\r , could take his foot in his laps, he applied himself to a process which\\r , Mr. Dawkins designated as \\'japanning his trotter-cases.\\'  The phrase,\\r , rendered into plain English, signifieth, cleaning his boots.\\r , \\r , Whether it was the sense of freedom and independence which a rational\\r , animal may be supposed to feel when he sits on a table in an easy\\r , attitude smoking a pipe, swinging one leg carelessly to and fro, and\\r , having his boots cleaned all the time, without even the past trouble of\\r , having taken them off, or the prospective misery of putting them on, to\\r , disturb his reflections; or whether it was the goodness of the tobacco\\r , that soothed the feelings of the Dodger, or the mildness of the beer\\r , that mollified his thoughts; he was evidently tinctured, for the nonce,\\r , with a spice of romance and enthusiasm, foreign to his general nature.\\r , He looked down on Oliver, with a thoughtful countenance, for a brief\\r , space; and then, raising his head, and heaving a gentle sign, said,\\r , half in abstraction, and half to Master Bates:\\r , \\r , \\'What a pity it is he isn\\'t a prig!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!\\' said Master Charles Bates; \\'he don\\'t know what\\'s good for him.\\'\\r , \\r , The Dodger sighed again, and resumed his pipe: as did Charley Bates.\\r , They both smoked, for some seconds, in silence.\\r , \\r , \\'I suppose you don\\'t even know what a prig is?\\' said the Dodger\\r , mournfully.\\r , \\r , \\'I think I know that,\\' replied Oliver, looking up.  \\'It\\'s a the--;\\r , you\\'re one, are you not?\\' inquired Oliver, checking himself.\\r , \\r , \\'I am,\\' replied the Dodger.  \\'I\\'d scorn to be anything else.\\'  Mr.\\r , Dawkins gave his hat a ferocious cock, after delivering this sentiment,\\r , and looked at Master Bates, as if to denote that he would feel obliged\\r , by his saying anything to the contrary.\\r , \\r , \\'I am,\\' repeated the Dodger.  \\'So\\'s Charley.  So\\'s Fagin. So\\'s Sikes.\\r , So\\'s Nancy.  So\\'s Bet.  So we all are, down to the dog. And he\\'s the\\r , downiest one of the lot!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And the least given to peaching,\\' added Charley Bates.\\r , \\r , \\'He wouldn\\'t so much as bark in a witness-box, for fear of committing\\r , himself; no, not if you tied him up in one, and left him there without\\r , wittles for a fortnight,\\' said the Dodger.\\r , \\r , \\'Not a bit of it,\\' observed Charley.\\r , \\r , \\'He\\'s a rum dog.  Don\\'t he look fierce at any strange cove that laughs\\r , or sings when he\\'s in company!\\' pursued the Dodger. \\'Won\\'t he growl at\\r , all, when he hears a fiddle playing!  And don\\'t he hate other dogs as\\r , ain\\'t of his breed!  Oh, no!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He\\'s an out-and-out Christian,\\' said Charley.\\r , \\r , This was merely intended as a tribute to the animal\\'s abilities, but it\\r , was an appropriate remark in another sense, if Master Bates had only\\r , known it; for there are a good many ladies and gentlemen, claiming to\\r , be out-and-out Christians, between whom, and Mr. Sikes\\' dog, there\\r , exist strong and singular points of resemblance.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, well,\\' said the Dodger, recurring to the point from which they\\r , had strayed: with that mindfulness of his profession which influenced\\r , all his proceedings.  \\'This hasn\\'t go anything to do with young Green\\r , here.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No more it has,\\' said Charley.  \\'Why don\\'t you put yourself under\\r , Fagin, Oliver?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And make your fortun\\' out of hand?\\' added the Dodger, with a grin.\\r , \\r , \\'And so be able to retire on your property, and do the gen-teel: as I\\r , mean to, in the very next leap-year but four that ever comes, and the\\r , forty-second Tuesday in Trinity-week,\\' said Charley Bates.\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t like it,\\' rejoined Oliver, timidly; \\'I wish they would let me\\r , go.  I--I--would rather go.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And Fagin would RATHER not!\\' rejoined Charley.\\r , \\r , Oliver knew this too well; but thinking it might be dangerous to\\r , express his feelings more openly, he only sighed, and went on with his\\r , boot-cleaning.\\r , \\r , \\'Go!\\' exclaimed the Dodger.  \\'Why, where\\'s your spirit?\\' Don\\'t you take\\r , any pride out of yourself?  Would you go and be dependent on your\\r , friends?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, blow that!\\' said Master Bates: drawing two or three silk\\r , handkerchiefs from his pocket, and tossing them into a cupboard,\\r , \\'that\\'s too mean; that is.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'_I_ couldn\\'t do it,\\' said the Dodger, with an air of haughty disgust.\\r , \\r , \\'You can leave your friends, though,\\' said Oliver with a half smile;\\r , \\'and let them be punished for what you did.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That,\\' rejoined the Dodger, with a wave of his pipe, \\'That was all out\\r , of consideration for Fagin, \\'cause the traps know that we work\\r , together, and he might have got into trouble if we hadn\\'t made our\\r , lucky; that was the move, wasn\\'t it, Charley?\\'\\r , \\r , Master Bates nodded assent, and would have spoken, but the recollection\\r , of Oliver\\'s flight came so suddenly upon him, that the smoke he was\\r , inhaling got entangled with a laugh, and went up into his head, and\\r , down into his throat: and brought on a fit of coughing and stamping,\\r , about five minutes long.\\r , \\r , \\'Look here!\\' said the Dodger, drawing forth a handful of shillings and\\r , halfpence. \\'Here\\'s a jolly life!  What\\'s the odds where it comes from?\\r , Here, catch hold; there\\'s plenty more where they were took from.  You\\r , won\\'t, won\\'t you?  Oh, you precious flat!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s naughty, ain\\'t it, Oliver?\\' inquired Charley Bates. \\'He\\'ll come\\r , to be scragged, won\\'t he?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t know what that means,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Something in this way, old feller,\\' said Charly.  As he said it,\\r , Master Bates caught up an end of his neckerchief; and, holding it erect\\r , in the air, dropped his head on his shoulder, and jerked a curious\\r , sound through his teeth; thereby indicating, by a lively pantomimic\\r , representation, that scragging and hanging were one and the same thing.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s what it means,\\' said Charley.  \\'Look how he stares, Jack!\\r , \\r , I never did see such prime company as that \\'ere boy; he\\'ll be the death\\r , of me, I know he will.\\'  Master Charley Bates, having laughed heartily\\r , again, resumed his pipe with tears in his eyes.\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'ve been brought up bad,\\' said the Dodger, surveying his boots with\\r , much satisfaction when Oliver had polished them. \\'Fagin will make\\r , something of you, though, or you\\'ll be the first he ever had that\\r , turned out unprofitable.  You\\'d better begin at once; for you\\'ll come\\r , to the trade long before you think of it; and you\\'re only losing time,\\r , Oliver.\\'\\r , \\r , Master Bates backed this advice with sundry moral admonitions of his\\r , own:  which, being exhausted, he and his friend Mr. Dawkins launched\\r , into a glowing description of the numerous pleasures incidental to the\\r , life they led, interspersed with a variety of hints to Oliver that the\\r , best thing he could do, would be to secure Fagin\\'s favour without more\\r , delay, by the means which they themselves had employed to gain it.\\r , \\r , \\'And always put this in your pipe, Nolly,\\' said the Dodger, as the Jew\\r , was heard unlocking the door above, \\'if you don\\'t take fogels and\\r , tickers--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s the good of talking in that way?\\' interposed Master Bates; \\'he\\r , don\\'t know what you mean.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If you don\\'t take pocket-handkechers and watches,\\' said the Dodger,\\r , reducing his conversation to the level of Oliver\\'s capacity, \\'some\\r , other cove will; so that the coves that lose \\'em will be all the worse,\\r , and you\\'ll be all the worse, too, and nobody half a ha\\'p\\'orth the\\r , better, except the chaps wot gets them--and you\\'ve just as good a right\\r , to them as they have.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'To be sure, to be sure!\\' said the Jew, who had entered unseen by\\r , Oliver.  \\'It all lies in a nutshell my dear; in a nutshell, take the\\r , Dodger\\'s word for it.  Ha! ha! ha!  He understands the catechism of his\\r , trade.\\'\\r , \\r , The old man rubbed his hands gleefully together, as he corroborated the\\r , Dodger\\'s reasoning in these terms; and chuckled with delight at his\\r , pupil\\'s proficiency.\\r , \\r , The conversation proceeded no farther at this time, for the Jew had\\r , returned home accompanied by Miss Betsy, and a gentleman whom Oliver\\r , had never seen before, but who was accosted by the Dodger as Tom\\r , Chitling; and who, having lingered on the stairs to exchange a few\\r , gallantries with the lady, now made his appearance.\\r , \\r , Mr. Chitling was older in years than the Dodger: having perhaps\\r , numbered eighteen winters; but there was a degree of deference in his\\r , deportment towards that young gentleman which seemed to indicate that\\r , he felt himself conscious of a slight inferiority in point of genius\\r , and professional aquirements.  He had small twinkling eyes, and a\\r , pock-marked face; wore a fur cap, a dark corduroy jacket, greasy\\r , fustian trousers, and an apron.  His wardrobe was, in truth, rather out\\r , of repair; but he excused himself to the company by stating that his\\r , \\'time\\' was only out an hour before; and that, in consequence of having\\r , worn the regimentals for six weeks past, he had not been able to bestow\\r , any attention on his private clothes.  Mr. Chitling added, with strong\\r , marks of irritation, that the new way of fumigating clothes up yonder\\r , was infernal unconstitutional, for it burnt holes in them, and there\\r , was no remedy against the County.  The same remark he considered to\\r , apply to the regulation mode of cutting the hair: which he held to be\\r , decidedly unlawful.  Mr. Chitling wound up his observations by stating\\r , that he had not touched a drop of anything for forty-two moral long\\r , hard-working days; and that he \\'wished he might be busted if he warn\\'t\\r , as dry as a lime-basket.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Where do you think the gentleman has come from, Oliver?\\' inquired the\\r , Jew, with a grin, as the other boys put a bottle of spirits on the\\r , table.\\r , \\r , \\'I--I--don\\'t know, sir,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Who\\'s that?\\' inquired Tom Chitling, casting a contemptuous look at\\r , Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'A young friend of mine, my dear,\\' replied the Jew.\\r , \\r , \\'He\\'s in luck, then,\\' said the young man, with a meaning look at Fagin.\\r , \\'Never mind where I came from, young \\'un; you\\'ll find your way there,\\r , soon enough, I\\'ll bet a crown!\\'\\r , \\r , At this sally, the boys laughed.  After some more jokes on the same\\r , subject, they exchanged a few short whispers with Fagin; and withdrew.\\r , \\r , After some words apart between the last comer and Fagin, they drew\\r , their chairs towards the fire; and the Jew, telling Oliver to come and\\r , sit by him, led the conversation to the topics most calculated to\\r , interest his hearers.  These were, the great advantages of the trade,\\r , the proficiency of the Dodger, the amiability of Charley Bates, and the\\r , liberality of the Jew himself.  At length these subjects displayed\\r , signs of being thoroughly exhausted; and Mr. Chitling did the same:\\r , for the house of correction becomes fatiguing after a week or two.\\r , Miss Betsy accordingly withdrew; and left the party to their repose.\\r , \\r , From this day, Oliver was seldom left alone; but was placed in almost\\r , constant communication with the two boys, who played the old game with\\r , the Jew every day: whether for their own improvement or Oliver\\'s, Mr.\\r , Fagin best knew.  At other times the old man would tell them stories of\\r , robberies he had committed in his younger days:  mixed up with so much\\r , that was droll and curious, that Oliver could not help laughing\\r , heartily, and showing that he was amused in spite of all his better\\r , feelings.\\r , \\r , In short, the wily old Jew had the boy in his toils.  Having prepared\\r , his mind, by solitude and gloom, to prefer any society to the\\r , companionship of his own sad thoughts in such a dreary place, he was\\r , now slowly instilling into his soul the poison which he hoped would\\r , blacken it, and change its hue for ever.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XIX\\r , \\r , IN WHICH A NOTABLE PLAN IS DISCUSSED AND DETERMINED ON\\r , \\r , It was a chill, damp, windy night, when the Jew: buttoning his\\r , great-coat tight round his shrivelled body, and pulling the collar up\\r , over his ears so as completely to obscure the lower part of his face:\\r , emerged from his den.  He paused on the step as the door was locked and\\r , chained behind him; and having listened while the boys made all secure,\\r , and until their retreating footsteps were no longer audible, slunk down\\r , the street as quickly as he could.\\r , \\r , The house to which Oliver had been conveyed, was in the neighborhood of\\r , Whitechapel.  The Jew stopped for an instant at the corner of the\\r , street; and, glancing suspiciously round, crossed the road, and struck\\r , off in the direction of the Spitalfields.\\r , \\r , The mud lay thick upon the stones, and a black mist hung over the\\r , streets; the rain fell sluggishly down, and everything felt cold and\\r , clammy to the touch.  It seemed just the night when it befitted such a\\r , being as the Jew to be abroad.  As he glided stealthily along, creeping\\r , beneath the shelter of the walls and doorways, the hideous old man\\r , seemed like some loathsome reptile, engendered in the slime and\\r , darkness through which he moved: crawling forth, by night, in search of\\r , some rich offal for a meal.\\r , \\r , He kept on his course, through many winding and narrow ways, until he\\r , reached Bethnal Green; then, turning suddenly off to the left, he soon\\r , became involved in a maze of the mean and dirty streets which abound in\\r , that close and densely-populated quarter.\\r , \\r , The Jew was evidently too familiar with the ground he traversed to be\\r , at all bewildered, either by the darkness of the night, or the\\r , intricacies of the way.  He hurried through several alleys and streets,\\r , and at length turned into one, lighted only by a single lamp at the\\r , farther end.  At the door of a house in this street, he knocked; having\\r , exchanged a few muttered words with the person who opened it, he walked\\r , upstairs.\\r , \\r , A dog growled as he touched the handle of a room-door; and a man\\'s\\r , voice demanded who was there.\\r , \\r , \\'Only me, Bill; only me, my dear,\\' said the Jew looking in.\\r , \\r , \\'Bring in your body then,\\' said Sikes.  \\'Lie down, you stupid brute!\\r , Don\\'t you know the devil when he\\'s got a great-coat on?\\'\\r , \\r , Apparently, the dog had been somewhat deceived by Mr. Fagin\\'s outer\\r , garment; for as the Jew unbuttoned it, and threw it over the back of a\\r , chair, he retired to the corner from which he had risen:  wagging his\\r , tail as he went, to show that he was as well satisfied as it was in his\\r , nature to be.\\r , \\r , \\'Well!\\' said Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, my dear,\\' replied the Jew.--\\'Ah! Nancy.\\'\\r , \\r , The latter recognition was uttered with just enough of embarrassment to\\r , imply a doubt of its reception; for Mr. Fagin and his young friend had\\r , not met, since she had interfered in behalf of Oliver.  All doubts upon\\r , the subject, if he had any, were speedily removed by the young lady\\'s\\r , behaviour.  She took her feet off the fender, pushed back her chair,\\r , and bade Fagin draw up his, without saying more about it:  for it was a\\r , cold night, and no mistake.\\r , \\r , \\'It is cold, Nancy dear,\\' said the Jew, as he warmed his skinny hands\\r , over the fire.  \\'It seems to go right through one,\\' added the old man,\\r , touching his side.\\r , \\r , \\'It must be a piercer, if it finds its way through your heart,\\' said\\r , Mr. Sikes.  \\'Give him something to drink, Nancy.  Burn my body, make\\r , haste!  It\\'s enough to turn a man ill, to see his lean old carcase\\r , shivering in that way, like a ugly ghost just rose from the grave.\\'\\r , \\r , Nancy quickly brought a bottle from a cupboard, in which there were\\r , many:  which, to judge from the diversity of their appearance, were\\r , filled with several kinds of liquids.  Sikes pouring out a glass of\\r , brandy, bade the Jew drink it off.\\r , \\r , \\'Quite enough, quite, thankye, Bill,\\' replied the Jew, putting down the\\r , glass after just setting his lips to it.\\r , \\r , \\'What!  You\\'re afraid of our getting the better of you, are you?\\'\\r , inquired Sikes, fixing his eyes on the Jew.  \\'Ugh!\\'\\r , \\r , With a hoarse grunt of contempt, Mr. Sikes seized the glass, and threw\\r , the remainder of its contents into the ashes: as a preparatory ceremony\\r , to filling it again for himself:  which he did at once.\\r , \\r , The Jew glanced round the room, as his companion tossed down the second\\r , glassful; not in curiousity, for he had seen it often before; but in a\\r , restless and suspicious manner habitual to him. It was a meanly\\r , furnished apartment, with nothing but the contents of the closet to\\r , induce the belief that its occupier was anything but a working man; and\\r , with no more suspicious articles displayed to view than two or three\\r , heavy bludgeons which stood in a corner, and a \\'life-preserver\\' that\\r , hung over the chimney-piece.\\r , \\r , \\'There,\\' said Sikes, smacking his lips. \\'Now I\\'m ready.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'For business?\\' inquired the Jew.\\r , \\r , \\'For business,\\' replied Sikes; \\'so say what you\\'ve got to say.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'About the crib at Chertsey, Bill?\\' said the Jew, drawing his chair\\r , forward, and speaking in a very low voice.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes.  Wot about it?\\' inquired Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah! you know what I mean, my dear,\\' said the Jew.  \\'He knows what I\\r , mean, Nancy; don\\'t he?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, he don\\'t,\\' sneered Mr. Sikes.  \\'Or he won\\'t, and that\\'s the same\\r , thing.  Speak out, and call things by their right names; don\\'t sit\\r , there, winking and blinking, and talking to me in hints, as if you\\r , warn\\'t the very first that thought about the robbery.  Wot d\\'ye mean?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hush, Bill, hush!\\' said the Jew, who had in vain attempted to stop\\r , this burst of indignation; \\'somebody will hear us, my dear. Somebody\\r , will hear us.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Let \\'em hear!\\' said Sikes; \\'I don\\'t care.\\'  But as Mr. Sikes DID care,\\r , on reflection, he dropped his voice as he said the words, and grew\\r , calmer.\\r , \\r , \\'There, there,\\' said the Jew, coaxingly.  \\'It was only my caution,\\r , nothing more.  Now, my dear, about that crib at Chertsey; when is it to\\r , be done, Bill, eh?  When is it to be done?  Such plate, my dear, such\\r , plate!\\' said the Jew:  rubbing his hands, and elevating his eyebrows in\\r , a rapture of anticipation.\\r , \\r , \\'Not at all,\\' replied Sikes coldly.\\r , \\r , \\'Not to be done at all!\\' echoed the Jew, leaning back in his chair.\\r , \\r , \\'No, not at all,\\' rejoined Sikes.  \\'At least it can\\'t be a put-up job,\\r , as we expected.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then it hasn\\'t been properly gone about,\\' said the Jew, turning pale\\r , with anger.  \\'Don\\'t tell me!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'But I will tell you,\\' retorted Sikes.  \\'Who are you that\\'s not to be\\r , told?  I tell you that Toby Crackit has been hanging about the place\\r , for a fortnight, and he can\\'t get one of the servants in line.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Do you mean to tell me, Bill,\\' said the Jew: softening as the other\\r , grew heated:  \\'that neither of the two men in the house can be got\\r , over?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, I do mean to tell you so,\\' replied Sikes.  \\'The old lady has had\\r , \\'em these twenty years; and if you were to give \\'em five hundred pound,\\r , they wouldn\\'t be in it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'But do you mean to say, my dear,\\' remonstrated the Jew, \\'that the\\r , women can\\'t be got over?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not a bit of it,\\' replied Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'Not by flash Toby Crackit?\\' said the Jew incredulously. \\'Think what\\r , women are, Bill,\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No; not even by flash Toby Crackit,\\' replied Sikes.  \\'He says he\\'s\\r , worn sham whiskers, and a canary waistcoat, the whole blessed time he\\'s\\r , been loitering down there, and it\\'s all of no use.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He should have tried mustachios and a pair of military trousers, my\\r , dear,\\' said the Jew.\\r , \\r , \\'So he did,\\' rejoined Sikes, \\'and they warn\\'t of no more use than the\\r , other plant.\\'\\r , \\r , The Jew looked blank at this information.  After ruminating for some\\r , minutes with his chin sunk on his breast, he raised his head and said,\\r , with a deep sigh, that if flash Toby Crackit reported aright, he feared\\r , the game was up.\\r , \\r , \\'And yet,\\' said the old man, dropping his hands on his knees, \\'it\\'s a\\r , sad thing, my dear, to lose so much when we had set our hearts upon it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'So it is,\\' said Mr. Sikes.  \\'Worse luck!\\'\\r , \\r , A long silence ensued; during which the Jew was plunged in deep\\r , thought, with his face wrinkled into an expression of villainy\\r , perfectly demoniacal.  Sikes eyed him furtively from time to time.\\r , Nancy, apparently fearful of irritating the housebreaker, sat with her\\r , eyes fixed upon the fire, as if she had been deaf to all that passed.\\r , \\r , \\'Fagin,\\' said Sikes, abruptly breaking the stillness that prevailed;\\r , \\'is it worth fifty shiners extra, if it\\'s safely done from the outside?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' said the Jew, as suddenly rousing himself.\\r , \\r , \\'Is it a bargain?\\' inquired Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, my dear, yes,\\' rejoined the Jew; his eyes glistening, and every\\r , muscle in his face working, with the excitement that the inquiry had\\r , awakened.\\r , \\r , \\'Then,\\' said Sikes, thrusting aside the Jew\\'s hand, with some disdain,\\r , \\'let it come off as soon as you like.  Toby and me were over the\\r , garden-wall the night afore last, sounding the panels of the door and\\r , shutters.  The crib\\'s barred up at night like a jail; but there\\'s one\\r , part we can crack, safe and softly.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Which is that, Bill?\\' asked the Jew eagerly.\\r , \\r , \\'Why,\\' whispered Sikes, \\'as you cross the lawn--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes?\\' said the Jew, bending his head forward, with his eyes almost\\r , starting out of it.\\r , \\r , \\'Umph!\\' cried Sikes, stopping short, as the girl, scarcely moving her\\r , head, looked suddenly round, and pointed for an instant to the Jew\\'s\\r , face.  \\'Never mind which part it is. You can\\'t do it without me, I\\r , know; but it\\'s best to be on the safe side when one deals with you.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'As you like, my dear, as you like\\' replied the Jew.  \\'Is there no help\\r , wanted, but yours and Toby\\'s?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'None,\\' said Sikes.  \\'Cept a centre-bit and a boy.  The first we\\'ve\\r , both got; the second you must find us.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'A boy!\\' exclaimed the Jew.  \\'Oh! then it\\'s a panel, eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Never mind wot it is!\\' replied Sikes.  \\'I want a boy, and he musn\\'t be\\r , a big \\'un.  Lord!\\' said Mr. Sikes, reflectively, \\'if I\\'d only got that\\r , young boy of Ned, the chimbley-sweeper\\'s!  He kept him small on\\r , purpose, and let him out by the job.  But the father gets lagged; and\\r , then the Juvenile Delinquent Society comes, and takes the boy away from\\r , a trade where he was earning money, teaches him to read and write, and\\r , in time makes a \\'prentice of him.  And so they go on,\\' said Mr. Sikes,\\r , his wrath rising with the recollection of his wrongs, \\'so they go on;\\r , and, if they\\'d got money enough (which it\\'s a Providence they haven\\'t,)\\r , we shouldn\\'t have half a dozen boys left in the whole trade, in a year\\r , or two.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No more we should,\\' acquiesced the Jew, who had been considering\\r , during this speech, and had only caught the last sentence. \\'Bill!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What now?\\' inquired Sikes.\\r , \\r , The Jew nodded his head towards Nancy, who was still gazing at the\\r , fire; and intimated, by a sign, that he would have her told to leave\\r , the room.  Sikes shrugged his shoulders impatiently, as if he thought\\r , the precaution unnecessary; but complied, nevertheless, by requesting\\r , Miss Nancy to fetch him a jug of beer.\\r , \\r , \\'You don\\'t want any beer,\\' said Nancy, folding her arms, and retaining\\r , her seat very composedly.\\r , \\r , \\'I tell you I do!\\' replied Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'Nonsense,\\' rejoined the girl coolly, \\'Go on, Fagin.  I know what he\\'s\\r , going to say, Bill; he needn\\'t mind me.\\'\\r , \\r , The Jew still hesitated.  Sikes looked from one to the other in some\\r , surprise.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, you don\\'t mind the old girl, do you, Fagin?\\' he asked at length.\\r , \\'You\\'ve known her long enough to trust her, or the Devil\\'s in it.  She\\r , ain\\'t one to blab.  Are you Nancy?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'_I_ should think not!\\' replied the young lady:  drawing her chair up\\r , to the table, and putting her elbows upon it.\\r , \\r , \\'No, no, my dear, I know you\\'re not,\\' said the Jew; \\'but--\\' and again\\r , the old man paused.\\r , \\r , \\'But wot?\\' inquired Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'I didn\\'t know whether she mightn\\'t p\\'r\\'aps be out of sorts, you know,\\r , my dear, as she was the other night,\\' replied the Jew.\\r , \\r , At this confession, Miss Nancy burst into a loud laugh; and, swallowing\\r , a glass of brandy, shook her head with an air of defiance, and burst\\r , into sundry exclamations of \\'Keep the game a-going!\\'  \\'Never say die!\\'\\r , and the like.  These seemed to have the effect of re-assuring both\\r , gentlemen; for the Jew nodded his head with a satisfied air, and\\r , resumed his seat: as did Mr. Sikes likewise.\\r , \\r , \\'Now, Fagin,\\' said Nancy with a laugh.  \\'Tell Bill at once, about\\r , Oliver!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ha! you\\'re a clever one, my dear: the sharpest girl I ever saw!\\' said\\r , the Jew, patting her on the neck.  \\'It WAS about Oliver I was going to\\r , speak, sure enough.  Ha! ha! ha!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What about him?\\' demanded Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'He\\'s the boy for you, my dear,\\' replied the Jew in a hoarse whisper;\\r , laying his finger on the side of his nose, and grinning frightfully.\\r , \\r , \\'He!\\' exclaimed Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'Have him, Bill!\\' said Nancy.  \\'I would, if I was in your place. He\\r , mayn\\'t be so much up, as any of the others; but that\\'s not what you\\r , want, if he\\'s only to open a door for you.  Depend upon it he\\'s a safe\\r , one, Bill.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I know he is,\\' rejoined Fagin.  \\'He\\'s been in good training these last\\r , few weeks, and it\\'s time he began to work for his bread.  Besides, the\\r , others are all too big.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, he is just the size I want,\\' said Mr. Sikes, ruminating.\\r , \\r , \\'And will do everything you want, Bill, my dear,\\' interposed the Jew;\\r , \\'he can\\'t help himself.  That is, if you frighten him enough.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Frighten him!\\' echoed Sikes.  \\'It\\'ll be no sham frightening, mind you.\\r , If there\\'s anything queer about him when we once get into the work; in\\r , for a penny, in for a pound.  You won\\'t see him alive again, Fagin.\\r , Think of that, before you send him.  Mark my words!\\' said the robber,\\r , poising a crowbar, which he had drawn from under the bedstead.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ve thought of it all,\\' said the Jew with energy. \\'I\\'ve--I\\'ve had my\\r , eye upon him, my dears, close--close. Once let him feel that he is one\\r , of us; once fill his mind with the idea that he has been a thief; and\\r , he\\'s ours!  Ours for his life.  Oho!  It couldn\\'t have come about\\r , better!  The old man crossed his arms upon his breast; and, drawing his\\r , head and shoulders into a heap, literally hugged himself for joy.\\r , \\r , \\'Ours!\\' said Sikes.  \\'Yours, you mean.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Perhaps I do, my dear,\\' said the Jew, with a shrill chuckle. \\'Mine, if\\r , you like, Bill.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And wot,\\' said Sikes, scowling fiercely on his agreeable friend, \\'wot\\r , makes you take so much pains about one chalk-faced kid, when you know\\r , there are fifty boys snoozing about Common Garden every night, as you\\r , might pick and choose from?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Because they\\'re of no use to me, my dear,\\' replied the Jew, with some\\r , confusion, \\'not worth the taking.  Their looks convict \\'em when they\\r , get into trouble, and I lose \\'em all.  With this boy, properly managed,\\r , my dears, I could do what I couldn\\'t with twenty of them.  Besides,\\'\\r , said the Jew, recovering his self-possession, \\'he has us now if he\\r , could only give us leg-bail again; and he must be in the same boat with\\r , us.  Never mind how he came there; it\\'s quite enough for my power over\\r , him that he was in a robbery; that\\'s all I want.  Now, how much better\\r , this is, than being obliged to put the poor leetle boy out of the\\r , way--which would be dangerous, and we should lose by it besides.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'When is it to be done?\\' asked Nancy, stopping some turbulent\\r , exclamation on the part of Mr. Sikes, expressive of the disgust with\\r , which he received Fagin\\'s affectation of humanity.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah, to be sure,\\' said the Jew; \\'when is it to be done, Bill?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I planned with Toby, the night arter to-morrow,\\' rejoined Sikes in a\\r , surly voice, \\'if he heerd nothing from me to the contrairy.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Good,\\' said the Jew; \\'there\\'s no moon.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' rejoined Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s all arranged about bringing off the swag, is it?\\' asked the Jew.\\r , \\r , Sikes nodded.\\r , \\r , \\'And about--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, ah, it\\'s all planned,\\' rejoined Sikes, interrupting him. \\'Never\\r , mind particulars.  You\\'d better bring the boy here to-morrow night.  I\\r , shall get off the stone an hour arter daybreak.  Then you hold your\\r , tongue, and keep the melting-pot ready, and that\\'s all you\\'ll have to\\r , do.\\'\\r , \\r , After some discussion, in which all three took an active part, it was\\r , decided that Nancy should repair to the Jew\\'s next evening when the\\r , night had set in, and bring Oliver away with her; Fagin craftily\\r , observing, that, if he evinced any disinclination to the task, he would\\r , be more willing to accompany the girl who had so recently interfered in\\r , his behalf, than anybody else.  It was also solemnly arranged that poor\\r , Oliver should, for the purposes of the contemplated expedition, be\\r , unreservedly consigned to the care and custody of Mr. William Sikes;\\r , and further, that the said Sikes should deal with him as he thought\\r , fit; and should not be held responsible by the Jew for any mischance or\\r , evil that might be necessary to visit him: it being understood that, to\\r , render the compact in this respect binding, any representations made by\\r , Mr. Sikes on his return should be required to be confirmed and\\r , corroborated, in all important particulars, by the testimony of flash\\r , Toby Crackit.\\r , \\r , These preliminaries adjusted, Mr. Sikes proceeded to drink brandy at a\\r , furious rate, and to flourish the crowbar in an alarming manner;\\r , yelling forth, at the same time, most unmusical snatches of song,\\r , mingled with wild execrations.  At length, in a fit of professional\\r , enthusiasm, he insisted upon producing his box of housebreaking tools:\\r , which he had no sooner stumbled in with, and opened for the purpose of\\r , explaining the nature and properties of the various implements it\\r , contained, and the peculiar beauties of their construction, than he\\r , fell over the box upon the floor, and went to sleep where he fell.\\r , \\r , \\'Good-night, Nancy,\\' said the Jew, muffling himself up as before.\\r , \\r , \\'Good-night.\\'\\r , \\r , Their eyes met, and the Jew scrutinised her, narrowly.  There was no\\r , flinching about the girl.  She was as true and earnest in the matter as\\r , Toby Crackit himself could be.\\r , \\r , The Jew again bade her good-night, and, bestowing a sly kick upon the\\r , prostrate form of Mr. Sikes while her back was turned, groped\\r , downstairs.\\r , \\r , \\'Always the way!\\' muttered the Jew to himself as he turned homeward.\\r , \\'The worst of these women is, that a very little thing serves to call\\r , up some long-forgotten feeling; and, the best of them is, that it never\\r , lasts.  Ha! ha!  The man against the child, for a bag of gold!\\'\\r , \\r , Beguiling the time with these pleasant reflections, Mr. Fagin wended\\r , his way, through mud and mire, to his gloomy abode:  where the Dodger\\r , was sitting up, impatiently awaiting his return.\\r , \\r , \\'Is Oliver a-bed?  I want to speak to him,\\' was his first remark as\\r , they descended the stairs.\\r , \\r , \\'Hours ago,\\' replied the Dodger, throwing open a door.  \\'Here he is!\\'\\r , \\r , The boy was lying, fast asleep, on a rude bed upon the floor; so pale\\r , with anxiety, and sadness, and the closeness of his prison, that he\\r , looked like death; not death as it shows in shroud and coffin, but in\\r , the guise it wears when life has just departed; when a young and gentle\\r , spirit has, but an instant, fled to Heaven, and the gross air of the\\r , world has not had time to breathe upon the changing dust it hallowed.\\r , \\r , \\'Not now,\\' said the Jew, turning softly away.  \\'To-morrow. To-morrow.\\'\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XX\\r , \\r , WHEREIN OLIVER IS DELIVERED OVER TO MR. WILLIAM SIKES\\r , \\r , When Oliver awoke in the morning, he was a good deal surprised to find\\r , that a new pair of shoes, with strong thick soles, had been placed at\\r , his bedside; and that his old shoes had been removed. At first, he was\\r , pleased with the discovery: hoping that it might be the forerunner of\\r , his release; but such thoughts were quickly dispelled, on his sitting\\r , down to breakfast along with the Jew, who told him, in a tone and\\r , manner which increased his alarm, that he was to be taken to the\\r , residence of Bill Sikes that night.\\r , \\r , \\'To--to--stop there, sir?\\' asked Oliver, anxiously.\\r , \\r , \\'No, no, my dear.  Not to stop there,\\' replied the Jew.  \\'We shouldn\\'t\\r , like to lose you.  Don\\'t be afraid, Oliver, you shall come back to us\\r , again.  Ha! ha! ha!  We won\\'t be so cruel as to send you away, my dear.\\r , Oh no, no!\\'\\r , \\r , The old man, who was stooping over the fire toasting a piece of bread,\\r , looked round as he bantered Oliver thus; and chuckled as if to show\\r , that he knew he would still be very glad to get away if he could.\\r , \\r , \\'I suppose,\\' said the Jew, fixing his eyes on Oliver, \\'you want to know\\r , what you\\'re going to Bill\\'s for---eh, my dear?\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver coloured, involuntarily, to find that the old thief had been\\r , reading his thoughts; but boldly said, Yes, he did want to know.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, do you think?\\' inquired Fagin, parrying the question.\\r , \\r , \\'Indeed I don\\'t know, sir,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Bah!\\' said the Jew, turning away with a disappointed countenance from\\r , a close perusal of the boy\\'s face.  \\'Wait till Bill tells you, then.\\'\\r , \\r , The Jew seemed much vexed by Oliver\\'s not expressing any greater\\r , curiosity on the subject; but the truth is, that, although Oliver felt\\r , very anxious, he was too much confused by the earnest cunning of\\r , Fagin\\'s looks, and his own speculations, to make any further inquiries\\r , just then.  He had no other opportunity:  for the Jew remained very\\r , surly and silent till night:  when he prepared to go abroad.\\r , \\r , \\'You may burn a candle,\\' said the Jew, putting one upon the table.\\r , \\'And here\\'s a book for you to read, till they come to fetch you.\\r , Good-night!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Good-night!\\' replied Oliver, softly.\\r , \\r , The Jew walked to the door: looking over his shoulder at the boy as he\\r , went.  Suddenly stopping, he called him by his name.\\r , \\r , Oliver looked up; the Jew, pointing to the candle, motioned him to\\r , light it.  He did so; and, as he placed the candlestick upon the table,\\r , saw that the Jew was gazing fixedly at him, with lowering and\\r , contracted brows, from the dark end of the room.\\r , \\r , \\'Take heed, Oliver! take heed!\\' said the old man, shaking his right\\r , hand before him in a warning manner.  \\'He\\'s a rough man, and thinks\\r , nothing of blood when his own is up. Whatever falls out, say nothing;\\r , and do what he bids you.  Mind!\\'  Placing a strong emphasis on the last\\r , word, he suffered his features gradually to resolve themselves into a\\r , ghastly grin, and, nodding his head, left the room.\\r , \\r , Oliver leaned his head upon his hand when the old man disappeared, and\\r , pondered, with a trembling heart, on the words he had just heard.  The\\r , more he thought of the Jew\\'s admonition, the more he was at a loss to\\r , divine its real purpose and meaning.\\r , \\r , He could think of no bad object to be attained by sending him to Sikes,\\r , which would not be equally well answered by his remaining with Fagin;\\r , and after meditating for a long time, concluded that he had been\\r , selected to perform some ordinary menial offices for the housebreaker,\\r , until another boy, better suited for his purpose could be engaged.  He\\r , was too well accustomed to suffering, and had suffered too much where\\r , he was, to bewail the prospect of change very severely.  He remained\\r , lost in thought for some minutes; and then, with a heavy sigh, snuffed\\r , the candle, and, taking up the book which the Jew had left with him,\\r , began to read.\\r , \\r , He turned over the leaves.  Carelessly at first; but, lighting on a\\r , passage which attracted his attention, he soon became intent upon the\\r , volume.  It was a history of the lives and trials of great criminals;\\r , and the pages were soiled and thumbed with use. Here, he read of\\r , dreadful crimes that made the blood run cold; of secret murders that\\r , had been committed by the lonely wayside; of bodies hidden from the eye\\r , of man in deep pits and wells: which would not keep them down, deep as\\r , they were, but had yielded them up at last, after many years, and so\\r , maddened the murderers with the sight, that in their horror they had\\r , confessed their guilt, and yelled for the gibbet to end their agony.\\r , Here, too, he read of men who, lying in their beds at dead of night,\\r , had been tempted (so they said) and led on, by their own bad thoughts,\\r , to such dreadful bloodshed as it made the flesh creep, and the limbs\\r , quail, to think of.  The terrible descriptions were so real and vivid,\\r , that the sallow pages seemed to turn red with gore; and the words upon\\r , them, to be sounded in his ears, as if they were whispered, in hollow\\r , murmurs, by the spirits of the dead.\\r , \\r , In a paroxysm of fear, the boy closed the book, and thrust it from him.\\r , Then, falling upon his knees, he prayed Heaven to spare him from such\\r , deeds; and rather to will that he should die at once, than be reserved\\r , for crimes, so fearful and appalling. By degrees, he grew more calm,\\r , and besought, in a low and broken voice, that he might be rescued from\\r , his present dangers; and that if any aid were to be raised up for a\\r , poor outcast boy who had never known the love of friends or kindred, it\\r , might come to him now, when, desolate and deserted, he stood alone in\\r , the midst of wickedness and guilt.\\r , \\r , He had concluded his prayer, but still remained with his head buried in\\r , his hands, when a rustling noise aroused him.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s that!\\' he cried, starting up, and catching sight of a figure\\r , standing by the door.  \\'Who\\'s there?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Me.  Only me,\\' replied a tremulous voice.\\r , \\r , Oliver raised the candle above his head: and looked towards the door.\\r , It was Nancy.\\r , \\r , \\'Put down the light,\\' said the girl, turning away her head. \\'It hurts\\r , my eyes.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver saw that she was very pale, and gently inquired if she were ill.\\r , The girl threw herself into a chair, with her back towards him:  and\\r , wrung her hands; but made no reply.\\r , \\r , \\'God forgive me!\\' she cried after a while, \\'I never thought of this.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Has anything happened?\\' asked Oliver.  \\'Can I help you?  I will if I\\r , can.  I will, indeed.\\'\\r , \\r , She rocked herself to and fro; caught her throat; and, uttering a\\r , gurgling sound, gasped for breath.\\r , \\r , \\'Nancy!\\' cried Oliver, \\'What is it?\\'\\r , \\r , The girl beat her hands upon her knees, and her feet upon the ground;\\r , and, suddenly stopping, drew her shawl close round her: and shivered\\r , with cold.\\r , \\r , Oliver stirred the fire.  Drawing her chair close to it, she sat there,\\r , for a little time, without speaking; but at length she raised her head,\\r , and looked round.\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t know what comes over me sometimes,\\' said she, affecting to\\r , busy herself in arranging her dress; \\'it\\'s this damp dirty room, I\\r , think.  Now, Nolly, dear, are you ready?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Am I to go with you?\\' asked Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes.  I have come from Bill,\\' replied the girl.  \\'You are to go with\\r , me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What for?\\' asked Oliver, recoiling.\\r , \\r , \\'What for?\\' echoed the girl, raising her eyes, and averting them again,\\r , the moment they encountered the boy\\'s face.  \\'Oh!  For no harm.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t believe it,\\' said Oliver:  who had watched her closely.\\r , \\r , \\'Have it your own way,\\' rejoined the girl, affecting to laugh. \\'For no\\r , good, then.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver could see that he had some power over the girl\\'s better\\r , feelings, and, for an instant, thought of appealing to her compassion\\r , for his helpless state.  But, then, the thought darted across his mind\\r , that it was barely eleven o\\'clock; and that many people were still in\\r , the streets:  of whom surely some might be found to give credence to\\r , his tale.  As the reflection occured to him, he stepped forward:  and\\r , said, somewhat hastily, that he was ready.\\r , \\r , Neither his brief consideration, nor its purport, was lost on his\\r , companion.  She eyed him narrowly, while he spoke; and cast upon him a\\r , look of intelligence which sufficiently showed that she guessed what\\r , had been passing in his thoughts.\\r , \\r , \\'Hush!\\' said the girl, stooping over him, and pointing to the door as\\r , she looked cautiously round.  \\'You can\\'t help yourself. I have tried\\r , hard for you, but all to no purpose.  You are hedged round and round.\\r , If ever you are to get loose from here, this is not the time.\\'\\r , \\r , Struck by the energy of her manner, Oliver looked up in her face with\\r , great surprise.  She seemed to speak the truth; her countenance was\\r , white and agitated; and she trembled with very earnestness.\\r , \\r , \\'I have saved you from being ill-used once, and I will again, and I do\\r , now,\\' continued the girl aloud; \\'for those who would have fetched you,\\r , if I had not, would have been far more rough than me.  I have promised\\r , for your being quiet and silent; if you are not, you will only do harm\\r , to yourself and me too, and perhaps be my death.  See here!  I have\\r , borne all this for you already, as true as God sees me show it.\\'\\r , \\r , She pointed, hastily, to some livid bruises on her neck and arms; and\\r , continued, with great rapidity:\\r , \\r , \\'Remember this!  And don\\'t let me suffer more for you, just now. If I\\r , could help you, I would; but I have not the power.  They don\\'t mean to\\r , harm you; whatever they make you do, is no fault of yours.  Hush!\\r , Every word from you is a blow for me.  Give me your hand.  Make haste!\\r , Your hand!\\'\\r , \\r , She caught the hand which Oliver instinctively placed in hers, and,\\r , blowing out the light, drew him after her up the stairs. The door was\\r , opened, quickly, by some one shrouded in the darkness, and was as\\r , quickly closed, when they had passed out.  A hackney-cabriolet was in\\r , waiting; with the same vehemence which she had exhibited in addressing\\r , Oliver, the girl pulled him in with her, and drew the curtains close.\\r , The driver wanted no directions, but lashed his horse into full speed,\\r , without the delay of an instant.\\r , \\r , The girl still held Oliver fast by the hand, and continued to pour into\\r , his ear, the warnings and assurances she had already imparted.  All was\\r , so quick and hurried, that he had scarcely time to recollect where he\\r , was, or how he came there, when the carriage stopped at the house to\\r , which the Jew\\'s steps had been directed on the previous evening.\\r , \\r , For one brief moment, Oliver cast a hurried glance along the empty\\r , street, and a cry for help hung upon his lips.  But the girl\\'s voice\\r , was in his ear, beseeching him in such tones of agony to remember her,\\r , that he had not the heart to utter it. While he hesitated, the\\r , opportunity was gone; he was already in the house, and the door was\\r , shut.\\r , \\r , \\'This way,\\' said the girl, releasing her hold for the first time.\\r , \\'Bill!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hallo!\\' replied Sikes: appearing at the head of the stairs, with a\\r , candle.  \\'Oh!  That\\'s the time of day.  Come on!\\'\\r , \\r , This was a very strong expression of approbation, an uncommonly hearty\\r , welcome, from a person of Mr. Sikes\\' temperament.  Nancy, appearing\\r , much gratified thereby, saluted him cordially.\\r , \\r , \\'Bull\\'s-eye\\'s gone home with Tom,\\' observed Sikes, as he lighted them\\r , up.  \\'He\\'d have been in the way.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s right,\\' rejoined Nancy.\\r , \\r , \\'So you\\'ve got the kid,\\' said Sikes when they had all reached the room:\\r , closing the door as he spoke.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, here he is,\\' replied Nancy.\\r , \\r , \\'Did he come quiet?\\' inquired Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'Like a lamb,\\' rejoined Nancy.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'m glad to hear it,\\' said Sikes, looking grimly at Oliver; \\'for the\\r , sake of his young carcase:  as would otherways have suffered for it.\\r , Come here, young \\'un; and let me read you a lectur\\', which is as well\\r , got over at once.\\'\\r , \\r , Thus addressing his new pupil, Mr. Sikes pulled off Oliver\\'s cap and\\r , threw it into a corner; and then, taking him by the shoulder, sat\\r , himself down by the table, and stood the boy in front of him.\\r , \\r , \\'Now, first:  do you know wot this is?\\' inquired Sikes, taking up a\\r , pocket-pistol which lay on the table.\\r , \\r , Oliver replied in the affirmative.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, then, look here,\\' continued Sikes.  \\'This is powder; that \\'ere\\'s\\r , a bullet; and this is a little bit of a old hat for waddin\\'.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver murmured his comprehension of the different bodies referred to;\\r , and Mr. Sikes proceeded to load the pistol, with great nicety and\\r , deliberation.\\r , \\r , \\'Now it\\'s loaded,\\' said Mr. Sikes, when he had finished.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, I see it is, sir,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'Well,\\' said the robber, grasping Oliver\\'s wrist, and putting the\\r , barrel so close to his temple that they touched; at which moment the\\r , boy could not repress a start; \\'if you speak a word when you\\'re out\\r , o\\'doors with me, except when I speak to you, that loading will be in\\r , your head without notice.  So, if you _do_ make up your mind to speak\\r , without leave, say your prayers first.\\'\\r , \\r , Having bestowed a scowl upon the object of this warning, to increase\\r , its effect, Mr. Sikes continued.\\r , \\r , \\'As near as I know, there isn\\'t anybody as would be asking very\\r , partickler arter you, if you _was_ disposed of; so I needn\\'t take this\\r , devil-and-all of trouble to explain matters to you, if it warn\\'t for\\r , your own good.  D\\'ye hear me?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The short and the long of what you mean,\\' said Nancy:  speaking very\\r , emphatically, and slightly frowning at Oliver as if to bespeak his\\r , serious attention to her words:  \\'is, that if you\\'re crossed by him in\\r , this job you have on hand, you\\'ll prevent his ever telling tales\\r , afterwards, by shooting him through the head, and will take your chance\\r , of swinging for it, as you do for a great many other things in the way\\r , of business, every month of your life.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s it!\\' observed Mr. Sikes, approvingly; \\'women can always put\\r , things in fewest words.--Except when it\\'s blowing up; and then they\\r , lengthens it out.  And now that he\\'s thoroughly up to it, let\\'s have\\r , some supper, and get a snooze before starting.\\'\\r , \\r , In pursuance of this request, Nancy quickly laid the cloth;\\r , disappearing for a few minutes, she presently returned with a pot of\\r , porter and a dish of sheep\\'s heads: which gave occasion to several\\r , pleasant witticisms on the part of Mr. Sikes, founded upon the singular\\r , coincidence of \\'jemmies\\' being a can name, common to them, and also to\\r , an ingenious implement much used in his profession.  Indeed, the worthy\\r , gentleman, stimulated perhaps by the immediate prospect of being on\\r , active service, was in great spirits and good humour; in proof whereof,\\r , it may be here remarked, that he humourously drank all the beer at a\\r , draught, and did not utter, on a rough calculation, more than\\r , four-score oaths during the whole progress of the meal.\\r , \\r , Supper being ended--it may be easily conceived that Oliver had no great\\r , appetite for it--Mr. Sikes disposed of a couple of glasses of spirits\\r , and water, and threw himself on the bed; ordering Nancy, with many\\r , imprecations in case of failure, to call him at five precisely.  Oliver\\r , stretched himself in his clothes, by command of the same authority, on\\r , a mattress upon the floor; and the girl, mending the fire, sat before\\r , it, in readiness to rouse them at the appointed time.\\r , \\r , For a long time Oliver lay awake, thinking it not impossible that Nancy\\r , might seek that opportunity of whispering some further advice; but the\\r , girl sat brooding over the fire, without moving, save now and then to\\r , trim the light.  Weary with watching and anxiety, he at length fell\\r , asleep.\\r , \\r , When he awoke, the table was covered with tea-things, and Sikes was\\r , thrusting various articles into the pockets of his great-coat, which\\r , hung over the back of a chair.  Nancy was busily engaged in preparing\\r , breakfast.  It was not yet daylight; for the candle was still burning,\\r , and it was quite dark outside. A sharp rain, too, was beating against\\r , the window-panes; and the sky looked black and cloudy.\\r , \\r , \\'Now, then!\\' growled Sikes, as Oliver started up; \\'half-past five!\\r , Look sharp, or you\\'ll get no breakfast; for it\\'s late as it is.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver was not long in making his toilet; having taken some breakfast,\\r , he replied to a surly inquiry from Sikes, by saying that he was quite\\r , ready.\\r , \\r , Nancy, scarcely looking at the boy, threw him a handkerchief to tie\\r , round his throat; Sikes gave him a large rough cape to button over his\\r , shoulders.  Thus attired, he gave his hand to the robber, who, merely\\r , pausing to show him with a menacing gesture that he had that same\\r , pistol in a side-pocket of his great-coat, clasped it firmly in his,\\r , and, exchanging a farewell with Nancy, led him away.\\r , \\r , Oliver turned, for an instant, when they reached the door, in the hope\\r , of meeting a look from the girl.  But she had resumed her old seat in\\r , front of the fire, and sat, perfectly motionless before it.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXI\\r , \\r , THE EXPEDITION\\r , \\r , It was a cheerless morning when they got into the street; blowing and\\r , raining hard; and the clouds looking dull and stormy.  The night had\\r , been very wet: large pools of water had collected in the road: and the\\r , kennels were overflowing.  There was a faint glimmering of the coming\\r , day in the sky; but it rather aggravated than relieved the gloom of the\\r , scene:  the sombre light only serving to pale that which the street\\r , lamps afforded, without shedding any warmer or brighter tints upon the\\r , wet house-tops, and dreary streets.  There appeared to be nobody\\r , stirring in that quarter of the town; the windows of the houses were\\r , all closely shut; and the streets through which they passed, were\\r , noiseless and empty.\\r , \\r , By the time they had turned into the Bethnal Green Road, the day had\\r , fairly begun to break.  Many of the lamps were already extinguished; a\\r , few country waggons were slowly toiling on, towards London; now and\\r , then, a stage-coach, covered with mud, rattled briskly by: the driver\\r , bestowing, as he passed, an admonitory lash upon the heavy waggoner\\r , who, by keeping on the wrong side of the road, had endangered his\\r , arriving at the office, a quarter of a minute after his time.  The\\r , public-houses, with gas-lights burning inside, were already open.  By\\r , degrees, other shops began to be unclosed, and a few scattered people\\r , were met with.  Then, came straggling groups of labourers going to\\r , their work; then, men and women with fish-baskets on their heads;\\r , donkey-carts laden with vegetables; chaise-carts filled with live-stock\\r , or whole carcasses of meat; milk-women with pails; an unbroken\\r , concourse of people, trudging out with various supplies to the eastern\\r , suburbs of the town.  As they approached the City, the noise and\\r , traffic gradually increased; when they threaded the streets between\\r , Shoreditch and Smithfield, it had swelled into a roar of sound and\\r , bustle.  It was as light as it was likely to be, till night came on\\r , again, and the busy morning of half the London population had begun.\\r , \\r , Turning down Sun Street and Crown Street, and crossing Finsbury square,\\r , Mr. Sikes struck, by way of Chiswell Street, into Barbican: thence into\\r , Long Lane, and so into Smithfield; from which latter place arose a\\r , tumult of discordant sounds that filled Oliver Twist with amazement.\\r , \\r , It was market-morning.  The ground was covered, nearly ankle-deep, with\\r , filth and mire; a thick steam, perpetually rising from the reeking\\r , bodies of the cattle, and mingling with the fog, which seemed to rest\\r , upon the chimney-tops, hung heavily above.  All the pens in the centre\\r , of the large area, and as many temporary pens as could be crowded into\\r , the vacant space, were filled with sheep; tied up to posts by the\\r , gutter side were long lines of beasts and oxen, three or four deep.\\r , Countrymen, butchers, drovers, hawkers, boys, thieves, idlers, and\\r , vagabonds of every low grade, were mingled together in a mass; the\\r , whistling of drovers, the barking dogs, the bellowing and plunging of\\r , the oxen, the bleating of sheep, the grunting and squeaking of pigs,\\r , the cries of hawkers, the shouts, oaths, and quarrelling on all sides;\\r , the ringing of bells and roar of voices, that issued from every\\r , public-house; the crowding, pushing, driving, beating, whooping and\\r , yelling; the hideous and discordant dim that resounded from every\\r , corner of the market; and the unwashed, unshaven, squalid, and dirty\\r , figures constantly running to and fro, and bursting in and out of the\\r , throng; rendered it a stunning and bewildering scene, which quite\\r , confounded the senses.\\r , \\r , Mr. Sikes, dragging Oliver after him, elbowed his way through the\\r , thickest of the crowd, and bestowed very little attention on the\\r , numerous sights and sounds, which so astonished the boy.  He nodded,\\r , twice or thrice, to a passing friend; and, resisting as many\\r , invitations to take a morning dram, pressed steadily onward, until they\\r , were clear of the turmoil, and had made their way through Hosier Lane\\r , into Holborn.\\r , \\r , \\'Now, young \\'un!\\' said Sikes, looking up at the clock of St. Andrew\\'s\\r , Church, \\'hard upon seven! you must step out.  Come, don\\'t lag behind\\r , already, Lazy-legs!\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Sikes accompanied this speech with a jerk at his little companion\\'s\\r , wrist; Oliver, quickening his pace into a kind of trot between a fast\\r , walk and a run, kept up with the rapid strides of the house-breaker as\\r , well as he could.\\r , \\r , They held their course at this rate, until they had passed Hyde Park\\r , corner, and were on their way to Kensington:  when Sikes relaxed his\\r , pace, until an empty cart which was at some little distance behind,\\r , came up.  Seeing \\'Hounslow\\' written on it, he asked the driver with as\\r , much civility as he could assume, if he would give them a lift as far\\r , as Isleworth.\\r , \\r , \\'Jump up,\\' said the man.  \\'Is that your boy?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes; he\\'s my boy,\\' replied Sikes, looking hard at Oliver, and putting\\r , his hand abstractedly into the pocket where the pistol was.\\r , \\r , \\'Your father walks rather too quick for you, don\\'t he, my man?\\'\\r , inquired the driver: seeing that Oliver was out of breath.\\r , \\r , \\'Not a bit of it,\\' replied Sikes, interposing.  \\'He\\'s used to it.\\r , \\r , Here, take hold of my hand, Ned.  In with you!\\'\\r , \\r , Thus addressing Oliver, he helped him into the cart; and the driver,\\r , pointing to a heap of sacks, told him to lie down there, and rest\\r , himself.\\r , \\r , As they passed the different mile-stones, Oliver wondered, more and\\r , more, where his companion meant to take him.  Kensington, Hammersmith,\\r , Chiswick, Kew Bridge, Brentford, were all passed; and yet they went on\\r , as steadily as if they had only just begun their journey.  At length,\\r , they came to a public-house called the Coach and Horses; a little way\\r , beyond which, another road appeared to run off.  And here, the cart\\r , stopped.\\r , \\r , Sikes dismounted with great precipitation, holding Oliver by the hand\\r , all the while; and lifting him down directly, bestowed a furious look\\r , upon him, and rapped the side-pocket with his fist, in a significant\\r , manner.\\r , \\r , \\'Good-bye, boy,\\' said the man.\\r , \\r , \\'He\\'s sulky,\\' replied Sikes, giving him a shake; \\'he\\'s sulky.  A young\\r , dog!  Don\\'t mind him.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not I!\\' rejoined the other, getting into his cart.  \\'It\\'s a fine day,\\r , after all.\\'  And he drove away.\\r , \\r , Sikes waited until he had fairly gone; and then, telling Oliver he\\r , might look about him if he wanted, once again led him onward on his\\r , journey.\\r , \\r , They turned round to the left, a short way past the public-house; and\\r , then, taking a right-hand road, walked on for a long time: passing many\\r , large gardens and gentlemen\\'s houses on both sides of the way, and\\r , stopping for nothing but a little beer, until they reached a town.\\r , Here against the wall of a house, Oliver saw written up in pretty large\\r , letters, \\'Hampton.\\'  They lingered about, in the fields, for some\\r , hours.  At length they came back into the town; and, turning into an\\r , old public-house with a defaced sign-board, ordered some dinner by the\\r , kitchen fire.\\r , \\r , The kitchen was an old, low-roofed room; with a great beam across the\\r , middle of the ceiling, and benches, with high backs to them, by the\\r , fire; on which were seated several rough men in smock-frocks, drinking\\r , and smoking.  They took no notice of Oliver; and very little of Sikes;\\r , and, as Sikes took very little notice of them, he and his young comrade\\r , sat in a corner by themselves, without being much troubled by their\\r , company.\\r , \\r , They had some cold meat for dinner, and sat so long after it, while Mr.\\r , Sikes indulged himself with three or four pipes, that Oliver began to\\r , feel quite certain they were not going any further.  Being much tired\\r , with the walk, and getting up so early, he dozed a little at first;\\r , then, quite overpowered by fatigue and the fumes of the tobacco, fell\\r , asleep.\\r , \\r , It was quite dark when he was awakened by a push from Sikes. Rousing\\r , himself sufficiently to sit up and look about him, he found that worthy\\r , in close fellowship and communication with a labouring man, over a pint\\r , of ale.\\r , \\r , \\'So, you\\'re going on to Lower Halliford, are you?\\' inquired Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, I am,\\' replied the man, who seemed a little the worse--or better,\\r , as the case might be--for drinking; \\'and not slow about it neither.  My\\r , horse hasn\\'t got a load behind him going back, as he had coming up in\\r , the mornin\\'; and he won\\'t be long a-doing of it.  Here\\'s luck to him.\\r , Ecod! he\\'s a good \\'un!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Could you give my boy and me a lift as far as there?\\' demanded Sikes,\\r , pushing the ale towards his new friend.\\r , \\r , \\'If you\\'re going directly, I can,\\' replied the man, looking out of the\\r , pot.  \\'Are you going to Halliford?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Going on to Shepperton,\\' replied Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'m your man, as far as I go,\\' replied the other.  \\'Is all paid,\\r , Becky?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, the other gentleman\\'s paid,\\' replied the girl.\\r , \\r , \\'I say!\\' said the man, with tipsy gravity; \\'that won\\'t do, you know.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why not?\\' rejoined Sikes.  \\'You\\'re a-going to accommodate us, and\\r , wot\\'s to prevent my standing treat for a pint or so, in return?\\'\\r , \\r , The stranger reflected upon this argument, with a very profound face;\\r , having done so, he seized Sikes by the hand:  and declared he was a\\r , real good fellow.  To which Mr. Sikes replied, he was joking; as, if he\\r , had been sober, there would have been strong reason to suppose he was.\\r , \\r , After the exchange of a few more compliments, they bade the company\\r , good-night, and went out; the girl gathering up the pots and glasses as\\r , they did so, and lounging out to the door, with her hands full, to see\\r , the party start.\\r , \\r , The horse, whose health had been drunk in his absence, was standing\\r , outside:  ready harnessed to the cart.  Oliver and Sikes got in without\\r , any further ceremony; and the man to whom he belonged, having lingered\\r , for a minute or two \\'to bear him up,\\' and to defy the hostler and the\\r , world to produce his equal, mounted also.  Then, the hostler was told\\r , to give the horse his head; and, his head being given him, he made a\\r , very unpleasant use of it:  tossing it into the air with great disdain,\\r , and running into the parlour windows over the way; after performing\\r , those feats, and supporting himself for a short time on his hind-legs,\\r , he started off at great speed, and rattled out of the town right\\r , gallantly.\\r , \\r , The night was very dark.  A damp mist rose from the river, and the\\r , marshy ground about; and spread itself over the dreary fields.  It was\\r , piercing cold, too; all was gloomy and black. Not a word was spoken;\\r , for the driver had grown sleepy; and Sikes was in no mood to lead him\\r , into conversation.  Oliver sat huddled together, in a corner of the\\r , cart; bewildered with alarm and apprehension; and figuring strange\\r , objects in the gaunt trees, whose branches waved grimly to and fro, as\\r , if in some fantastic joy at the desolation of the scene.\\r , \\r , As they passed Sunbury Church, the clock struck seven.  There was a\\r , light in the ferry-house window opposite:  which streamed across the\\r , road, and threw into more sombre shadow a dark yew-tree with graves\\r , beneath it.  There was a dull sound of falling water not far off; and\\r , the leaves of the old tree stirred gently in the night wind.  It seemed\\r , like quiet music for the repose of the dead.\\r , \\r , Sunbury was passed through, and they came again into the lonely road.\\r , Two or three miles more, and the cart stopped.  Sikes alighted, took\\r , Oliver by the hand, and they once again walked on.\\r , \\r , They turned into no house at Shepperton, as the weary boy had expected;\\r , but still kept walking on, in mud and darkness, through gloomy lanes\\r , and over cold open wastes, until they came within sight of the lights\\r , of a town at no great distance.  On looking intently forward, Oliver\\r , saw that the water was just below them, and that they were coming to\\r , the foot of a bridge.\\r , \\r , Sikes kept straight on, until they were close upon the bridge; then\\r , turned suddenly down a bank upon the left.\\r , \\r , \\'The water!\\' thought Oliver, turning sick with fear.  \\'He has brought\\r , me to this lonely place to murder me!\\'\\r , \\r , He was about to throw himself on the ground, and make one struggle for\\r , his young life, when he saw that they stood before a solitary house:\\r , all ruinous and decayed.  There was a window on each side of the\\r , dilapidated entrance; and one story above; but no light was visible.\\r , The house was dark, dismantled: and the all appearance, uninhabited.\\r , \\r , Sikes, with Oliver\\'s hand still in his, softly approached the low\\r , porch, and raised the latch.  The door yielded to the pressure, and\\r , they passed in together.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXII\\r , \\r , THE BURGLARY\\r , \\r , \\'Hallo!\\' cried a loud, hoarse voice, as soon as they set foot in the\\r , passage.\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t make such a row,\\' said Sikes, bolting the door.  \\'Show a glim,\\r , Toby.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Aha! my pal!\\' cried the same voice.  \\'A glim, Barney, a glim! Show the\\r , gentleman in, Barney; wake up first, if convenient.\\'\\r , \\r , The speaker appeared to throw a boot-jack, or some such article, at the\\r , person he addressed, to rouse him from his slumbers:  for the noise of\\r , a wooden body, falling violently, was heard; and then an indistinct\\r , muttering, as of a man between sleep and awake.\\r , \\r , \\'Do you hear?\\' cried the same voice.  \\'There\\'s Bill Sikes in the\\r , passage with nobody to do the civil to him; and you sleeping there, as\\r , if you took laudanum with your meals, and nothing stronger.  Are you\\r , any fresher now, or do you want the iron candlestick to wake you\\r , thoroughly?\\'\\r , \\r , A pair of slipshod feet shuffled, hastily, across the bare floor of the\\r , room, as this interrogatory was put; and there issued, from a door on\\r , the right hand; first, a feeble candle:  and next, the form of the same\\r , individual who has been heretofore described as labouring under the\\r , infirmity of speaking through his nose, and officiating as waiter at\\r , the public-house on Saffron Hill.\\r , \\r , \\'Bister Sikes!\\' exclaimed Barney, with real or counterfeit joy; \\'cub\\r , id, sir; cub id.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Here! you get on first,\\' said Sikes, putting Oliver in front of him.\\r , \\'Quicker! or I shall tread upon your heels.\\'\\r , \\r , Muttering a curse upon his tardiness, Sikes pushed Oliver before him;\\r , and they entered a low dark room with a smoky fire, two or three broken\\r , chairs, a table, and a very old couch:  on which, with his legs much\\r , higher than his head, a man was reposing at full length, smoking a long\\r , clay pipe.  He was dressed in a smartly-cut snuff-coloured coat, with\\r , large brass buttons; an orange neckerchief; a coarse, staring,\\r , shawl-pattern waistcoat; and drab breeches.  Mr. Crackit (for he it\\r , was) had no very great quantity of hair, either upon his head or face;\\r , but what he had, was of a reddish dye, and tortured into long corkscrew\\r , curls, through which he occasionally thrust some very dirty fingers,\\r , ornamented with large common rings.  He was a trifle above the middle\\r , size, and apparently rather weak in the legs; but this circumstance by\\r , no means detracted from his own admiration of his top-boots, which he\\r , contemplated, in their elevated situation, with lively satisfaction.\\r , \\r , \\'Bill, my boy!\\' said this figure, turning his head towards the door,\\r , \\'I\\'m glad to see you.  I was almost afraid you\\'d given it up:  in which\\r , case I should have made a personal wentur.  Hallo!\\'\\r , \\r , Uttering this exclamation in a tone of great surprise, as his eyes\\r , rested on Oliver, Mr. Toby Crackit brought himself into a sitting\\r , posture, and demanded who that was.\\r , \\r , \\'The boy.  Only the boy!\\' replied Sikes, drawing a chair towards the\\r , fire.\\r , \\r , \\'Wud of Bister Fagid\\'s lads,\\' exclaimed Barney, with a grin.\\r , \\r , \\'Fagin\\'s, eh!\\' exclaimed Toby, looking at Oliver.  \\'Wot an inwalable\\r , boy that\\'ll make, for the old ladies\\' pockets in chapels!  His mug is a\\r , fortin\\' to him.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'There--there\\'s enough of that,\\' interposed Sikes, impatiently; and\\r , stooping over his recumbant friend, he whispered a few words in his\\r , ear:  at which Mr. Crackit laughed immensely, and honoured Oliver with\\r , a long stare of astonishment.\\r , \\r , \\'Now,\\' said Sikes, as he resumed his seat, \\'if you\\'ll give us something\\r , to eat and drink while we\\'re waiting, you\\'ll put some heart in us; or\\r , in me, at all events.  Sit down by the fire, younker, and rest\\r , yourself; for you\\'ll have to go out with us again to-night, though not\\r , very far off.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver looked at Sikes, in mute and timid wonder; and drawing a stool\\r , to the fire, sat with his aching head upon his hands, scarecely knowing\\r , where he was, or what was passing around him.\\r , \\r , \\'Here,\\' said Toby, as the young Jew placed some fragments of food, and\\r , a bottle upon the table,  \\'Success to the crack!\\'  He rose to honour\\r , the toast; and, carefully depositing his empty pipe in a corner,\\r , advanced to the table, filled a glass with spirits, and drank off its\\r , contents.  Mr. Sikes did the same.\\r , \\r , \\'A drain for the boy,\\' said Toby, half-filling a wine-glass. \\'Down with\\r , it, innocence.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Indeed,\\' said Oliver, looking piteously up into the man\\'s face;\\r , \\'indeed, I--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Down with it!\\' echoed Toby.  \\'Do you think I don\\'t know what\\'s good\\r , for you?  Tell him to drink it, Bill.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He had better!\\' said Sikes clapping his hand upon his pocket. \\'Burn my\\r , body, if he isn\\'t more trouble than a whole family of Dodgers.  Drink\\r , it, you perwerse imp; drink it!\\'\\r , \\r , Frightened by the menacing gestures of the two men, Oliver hastily\\r , swallowed the contents of the glass, and immediately fell into a\\r , violent fit of coughing:  which delighted Toby Crackit and Barney, and\\r , even drew a smile from the surly Mr. Sikes.\\r , \\r , This done, and Sikes having satisfied his appetite (Oliver could eat\\r , nothing but a small crust of bread which they made him swallow), the\\r , two men laid themselves down on chairs for a short nap.  Oliver\\r , retained his stool by the fire; Barney wrapped in a blanket, stretched\\r , himself on the floor:  close outside the fender.\\r , \\r , They slept, or appeared to sleep, for some time; nobody stirring but\\r , Barney, who rose once or twice to throw coals on the fire. Oliver fell\\r , into a heavy doze:  imagining himself straying along the gloomy lanes,\\r , or wandering about the dark churchyard, or retracing some one or other\\r , of the scenes of the past day:  when he was roused by Toby Crackit\\r , jumping up and declaring it was half-past one.\\r , \\r , In an instant, the other two were on their legs, and all were actively\\r , engaged in busy preparation.  Sikes and his companion enveloped their\\r , necks and chins in large dark shawls, and drew on their great-coats;\\r , Barney, opening a cupboard, brought forth several articles, which he\\r , hastily crammed into the pockets.\\r , \\r , \\'Barkers for me, Barney,\\' said Toby Crackit.\\r , \\r , \\'Here they are,\\' replied Barney, producing a pair of pistols. \\'You\\r , loaded them yourself.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'All right!\\' replied Toby, stowing them away.  \\'The persuaders?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ve got \\'em,\\' replied Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'Crape, keys, centre-bits, darkies--nothing forgotten?\\' inquired Toby:\\r , fastening a small crowbar to a loop inside the skirt of his coat.\\r , \\r , \\'All right,\\' rejoined his companion.  \\'Bring them bits of timber,\\r , Barney.  That\\'s the time of day.\\'\\r , \\r , With these words, he took a thick stick from Barney\\'s hands, who,\\r , having delivered another to Toby, busied himself in fastening on\\r , Oliver\\'s cape.\\r , \\r , \\'Now then!\\' said Sikes, holding out his hand.\\r , \\r , Oliver:  who was completely stupified by the unwonted exercise, and the\\r , air, and the drink which had been forced upon him:  put his hand\\r , mechanically into that which Sikes extended for the purpose.\\r , \\r , \\'Take his other hand, Toby,\\' said Sikes.  \\'Look out, Barney.\\'\\r , \\r , The man went to the door, and returned to announce that all was quiet.\\r , The two robbers issued forth with Oliver between them. Barney, having\\r , made all fast, rolled himself up as before, and was soon asleep again.\\r , \\r , It was now intensely dark.  The fog was much heavier than it had been\\r , in the early part of the night; and the atmosphere was so damp, that,\\r , although no rain fell, Oliver\\'s hair and eyebrows, within a few minutes\\r , after leaving the house, had become stiff with the half-frozen moisture\\r , that was floating about.  They crossed the bridge, and kept on towards\\r , the lights which he had seen before.  They were at no great distance\\r , off; and, as they walked pretty briskly, they soon arrived at Chertsey.\\r , \\r , \\'Slap through the town,\\' whispered Sikes; \\'there\\'ll be nobody in the\\r , way, to-night, to see us.\\'\\r , \\r , Toby acquiesced; and they hurried through the main street of the little\\r , town, which at that late hour was wholly deserted.  A dim light shone\\r , at intervals from some bed-room window; and the hoarse barking of dogs\\r , occasionally broke the silence of the night.  But there was nobody\\r , abroad.  They had cleared the town, as the church-bell struck two.\\r , \\r , Quickening their pace, they turned up a road upon the left hand. After\\r , walking about a quarter of a mile, they stopped before a detached house\\r , surrounded by a wall:  to the top of which, Toby Crackit, scarcely\\r , pausing to take breath, climbed in a twinkling.\\r , \\r , \\'The boy next,\\' said Toby.  \\'Hoist him up; I\\'ll catch hold of him.\\'\\r , \\r , Before Oliver had time to look round, Sikes had caught him under the\\r , arms; and in three or four seconds he and Toby were lying on the grass\\r , on the other side.  Sikes followed directly.  And they stole cautiously\\r , towards the house.\\r , \\r , And now, for the first time, Oliver, well-nigh mad with grief and\\r , terror, saw that housebreaking and robbery, if not murder, were the\\r , objects of the expedition.  He clasped his hands together, and\\r , involuntarily uttered a subdued exclamation of horror.  A mist came\\r , before his eyes; the cold sweat stood upon his ashy face; his limbs\\r , failed him; and he sank upon his knees.\\r , \\r , \\'Get up!\\' murmured Sikes, trembling with rage, and drawing the pistol\\r , from his pocket; \\'Get up, or I\\'ll strew your brains upon the grass.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh! for God\\'s sake let me go!\\' cried Oliver; \\'let me run away and die\\r , in the fields.  I will never come near London; never, never!  Oh! pray\\r , have mercy on me, and do not make me steal.  For the love of all the\\r , bright Angels that rest in Heaven, have mercy upon me!\\'\\r , \\r , The man to whom this appeal was made, swore a dreadful oath, and had\\r , cocked the pistol, when Toby, striking it from his grasp, placed his\\r , hand upon the boy\\'s mouth, and dragged him to the house.\\r , \\r , \\'Hush!\\' cried the man; \\'it won\\'t answer here.  Say another word, and\\r , I\\'ll do your business myself with a crack on the head.  That makes no\\r , noise, and is quite as certain, and more genteel.  Here, Bill, wrench\\r , the shutter open.  He\\'s game enough now, I\\'ll engage.  I\\'ve seen older\\r , hands of his age took the same way, for a minute or two, on a cold\\r , night.\\'\\r , \\r , Sikes, invoking terrific imprecations upon Fagin\\'s head for sending\\r , Oliver on such an errand, plied the crowbar vigorously, but with little\\r , noise.  After some delay, and some assistance from Toby, the shutter to\\r , which he had referred, swung open on its hinges.\\r , \\r , It was a little lattice window, about five feet and a half above the\\r , ground, at the back of the house:  which belonged to a scullery, or\\r , small brewing-place, at the end of the passage.  The aperture was so\\r , small, that the inmates had probably not thought it worth while to\\r , defend it more securely; but it was large enough to admit a boy of\\r , Oliver\\'s size, nevertheless.  A very brief exercise of Mr. Sike\\'s art,\\r , sufficed to overcome the fastening of the lattice; and it soon stood\\r , wide open also.\\r , \\r , \\'Now listen, you young limb,\\' whispered Sikes, drawing a dark lantern\\r , from his pocket, and throwing the glare full on Oliver\\'s face; \\'I\\'m a\\r , going to put you through there.  Take this light; go softly up the\\r , steps straight afore you, and along the little hall, to the street\\r , door; unfasten it, and let us in.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'There\\'s a bolt at the top, you won\\'t be able to reach,\\' interposed\\r , Toby. \\'Stand upon one of the hall chairs.  There are three there, Bill,\\r , with a jolly large blue unicorn and gold pitchfork on \\'em:  which is\\r , the old lady\\'s arms.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Keep quiet, can\\'t you?\\' replied Sikes, with a threatening look. \\'The\\r , room-door is open, is it?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Wide,\\' replied Toby, after peeping in to satisfy himself. \\'The game of\\r , that is, that they always leave it open with a catch, so that the dog,\\r , who\\'s got a bed in here, may walk up and down the passage when he feels\\r , wakeful.  Ha! ha! Barney \\'ticed him away to-night.  So neat!\\'\\r , \\r , Although Mr. Crackit spoke in a scarcely audible whisper, and laughed\\r , without noise, Sikes imperiously commanded him to be silent, and to get\\r , to work.  Toby complied, by first producing his lantern, and placing it\\r , on the ground; then by planting himself firmly with his head against\\r , the wall beneath the window, and his hands upon his knees, so as to\\r , make a step of his back. This was no sooner done, than Sikes, mounting\\r , upon him, put Oliver gently through the window with his feet first;\\r , and, without leaving hold of his collar, planted him safely on the\\r , floor inside.\\r , \\r , \\'Take this lantern,\\' said Sikes, looking into the room.  \\'You see the\\r , stairs afore you?\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver, more dead than alive, gasped out, \\'Yes.\\'  Sikes, pointing to\\r , the street-door with the pistol-barrel, briefly advised him to take\\r , notice that he was within shot all the way; and that if he faltered, he\\r , would fall dead that instant.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s done in a minute,\\' said Sikes, in the same low whisper. \\'Directly\\r , I leave go of you, do your work.  Hark!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s that?\\' whispered the other man.\\r , \\r , They listened intently.\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing,\\' said Sikes, releasing his hold of Oliver.  \\'Now!\\'\\r , \\r , In the short time he had had to collect his senses, the boy had firmly\\r , resolved that, whether he died in the attempt or not, he would make one\\r , effort to dart upstairs from the hall, and alarm the family.  Filled\\r , with this idea, he advanced at once, but stealthily.\\r , \\r , \\'Come back!\\' suddenly cried Sikes aloud.  \\'Back! back!\\'\\r , \\r , Scared by the sudden breaking of the dead stillness of the place, and\\r , by a loud cry which followed it, Oliver let his lantern fall, and knew\\r , not whether to advance or fly.\\r , \\r , The cry was repeated--a light appeared--a vision of two terrified\\r , half-dressed men at the top of the stairs swam before his eyes--a\\r , flash--a loud noise--a smoke--a crash somewhere, but where he knew\\r , not,--and he staggered back.\\r , \\r , Sikes had disappeared for an instant; but he was up again, and had him\\r , by the collar before the smoke had cleared away.  He fired his own\\r , pistol after the men, who were already retreating; and dragged the boy\\r , up.\\r , \\r , \\'Clasp your arm tighter,\\' said Sikes, as he drew him through the\\r , window.  \\'Give me a shawl here.  They\\'ve hit him.  Quick!  How the boy\\r , bleeds!\\'\\r , \\r , Then came the loud ringing of a bell, mingled with the noise of\\r , fire-arms, and the shouts of men, and the sensation of being carried\\r , over uneven ground at a rapid pace.  And then, the noises grew confused\\r , in the distance; and a cold deadly feeling crept over the boy\\'s heart;\\r , and he saw or heard no more.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXIII\\r , \\r , WHICH CONTAINS THE SUBSTANCE OF A PLEASANT CONVERSATION BETWEEN MR.\\r , BUMBLE AND A LADY; AND SHOWS THAT EVEN A BEADLE MAY BE SUSCEPTIBLE ON\\r , SOME POINTS\\r , \\r , The night was bitter cold.  The snow lay on the ground, frozen into a\\r , hard thick crust, so that only the heaps that had drifted into byways\\r , and corners were affected by the sharp wind that howled abroad:  which,\\r , as if expending increased fury on such prey as it found, caught it\\r , savagely up in clouds, and, whirling it into a thousand misty eddies,\\r , scattered it in air.  Bleak, dark, and piercing cold, it was a night\\r , for the well-housed and fed to draw round the bright fire and thank God\\r , they were at home; and for the homeless, starving wretch to lay him\\r , down and die.  Many hunger-worn outcasts close their eyes in our bare\\r , streets, at such times, who, let their crimes have been what they may,\\r , can hardly open them in a more bitter world.\\r , \\r , Such was the aspect of out-of-doors affairs, when Mrs. Corney, the\\r , matron of the workhouse to which our readers have been already\\r , introduced as the birthplace of Oliver Twist, sat herself down before a\\r , cheerful fire in her own little room, and glanced, with no small degree\\r , of complacency, at a small round table:  on which stood a tray of\\r , corresponding size, furnished with all necessary materials for the most\\r , grateful meal that matrons enjoy.  In fact, Mrs. Corney was about to\\r , solace herself with a cup of tea. As she glanced from the table to the\\r , fireplace, where the smallest of all possible kettles was singing a\\r , small song in a small voice, her inward satisfaction evidently\\r , increased,--so much so, indeed, that Mrs. Corney smiled.\\r , \\r , \\'Well!\\' said the matron, leaning her elbow on the table, and looking\\r , reflectively at the fire; \\'I\\'m sure we have all on us a great deal to\\r , be grateful for!  A great deal, if we did but know it.  Ah!\\'\\r , \\r , Mrs. Corney shook her head mournfully, as if deploring the mental\\r , blindness of those paupers who did not know it; and thrusting a silver\\r , spoon (private property) into the inmost recesses of a two-ounce tin\\r , tea-caddy, proceeded to make the tea.\\r , \\r , How slight a thing will disturb the equanimity of our frail minds!  The\\r , black teapot, being very small and easily filled, ran over while Mrs.\\r , Corney was moralising; and the water slightly scalded Mrs. Corney\\'s\\r , hand.\\r , \\r , \\'Drat the pot!\\' said the worthy matron, setting it down very hastily on\\r , the hob; \\'a little stupid thing, that only holds a couple of cups!\\r , What use is it of, to anybody!  Except,\\' said Mrs. Corney, pausing,\\r , \\'except to a poor desolate creature like me.  Oh dear!\\'\\r , \\r , With these words, the matron dropped into her chair, and, once more\\r , resting her elbow on the table, thought of her solitary fate.  The\\r , small teapot, and the single cup, had awakened in her mind sad\\r , recollections of Mr. Corney (who had not been dead more than\\r , five-and-twenty years); and she was overpowered.\\r , \\r , \\'I shall never get another!\\' said Mrs. Corney, pettishly; \\'I shall\\r , never get another--like him.\\'\\r , \\r , Whether this remark bore reference to the husband, or the teapot, is\\r , uncertain.  It might have been the latter; for Mrs. Corney looked at it\\r , as she spoke; and took it up afterwards.  She had just tasted her first\\r , cup, when she was disturbed by a soft tap at the room-door.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, come in with you!\\' said Mrs. Corney, sharply.  \\'Some of the old\\r , women dying, I suppose.  They always die when I\\'m at meals. Don\\'t stand\\r , there, letting the cold air in, don\\'t.  What\\'s amiss now, eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing, ma\\'am, nothing,\\' replied a man\\'s voice.\\r , \\r , \\'Dear me!\\' exclaimed the matron, in a much sweeter tone, \\'is that Mr.\\r , Bumble?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'At your service, ma\\'am,\\' said Mr. Bumble, who had been stopping\\r , outside to rub his shoes clean, and to shake the snow off his coat; and\\r , who now made his appearance, bearing the cocked hat in one hand and a\\r , bundle in the other.  \\'Shall I shut the door, ma\\'am?\\'\\r , \\r , The lady modestly hesitated to reply, lest there should be any\\r , impropriety in holding an interview with Mr. Bumble, with closed doors.\\r , Mr. Bumble taking advantage of the hesitation, and being very cold\\r , himself, shut it without permission.\\r , \\r , \\'Hard weather, Mr. Bumble,\\' said the matron.\\r , \\r , \\'Hard, indeed, ma\\'am,\\' replied the beadle.  \\'Anti-porochial weather\\r , this, ma\\'am.  We have given away, Mrs. Corney, we have given away a\\r , matter of twenty quartern loaves and a cheese and a half, this very\\r , blessed afternoon; and yet them paupers are not contented.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Of course not.  When would they be, Mr. Bumble?\\' said the matron,\\r , sipping her tea.\\r , \\r , \\'When, indeed, ma\\'am!\\' rejoined Mr. Bumble.  \\'Why here\\'s one man that,\\r , in consideration of his wife and large family, has a quartern loaf and\\r , a good pound of cheese, full weight.  Is he grateful, ma\\'am?  Is he\\r , grateful?  Not a copper farthing\\'s worth of it!  What does he do,\\r , ma\\'am, but ask for a few coals; if it\\'s only a pocket handkerchief\\r , full, he says!  Coals! What would he do with coals?  Toast his cheese\\r , with \\'em and then come back for more.  That\\'s the way with these\\r , people, ma\\'am; give \\'em a apron full of coals to-day, and they\\'ll come\\r , back for another, the day after to-morrow, as brazen as alabaster.\\'\\r , \\r , The matron expressed her entire concurrence in this intelligible\\r , simile; and the beadle went on.\\r , \\r , \\'I never,\\' said Mr. Bumble, \\'see anything like the pitch it\\'s got to.\\r , The day afore yesterday, a man--you have been a married woman, ma\\'am,\\r , and I may mention it to you--a man, with hardly a rag upon his back\\r , (here Mrs. Corney looked at the floor), goes to our overseer\\'s door\\r , when he has got company coming to dinner; and says, he must be\\r , relieved, Mrs. Corney.  As he wouldn\\'t go away, and shocked the company\\r , very much, our overseer sent him out a pound of potatoes and half a\\r , pint of oatmeal.  \"My heart!\" says the ungrateful villain, \"what\\'s the\\r , use of _this_ to me?  You might as well give me a pair of iron\\r , spectacles!\"  \"Very good,\" says our overseer, taking \\'em away again,\\r , \"you won\\'t get anything else here.\"  \"Then I\\'ll die in the streets!\"\\r , says the vagrant.  \"Oh no, you won\\'t,\" says our overseer.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ha! ha!  That was very good!  So like Mr. Grannett, wasn\\'t it?\\'\\r , interposed the matron.  \\'Well, Mr. Bumble?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, ma\\'am,\\' rejoined the beadle, \\'he went away; and he _did_ die in\\r , the streets.  There\\'s a obstinate pauper for you!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It beats anything I could have believed,\\' observed the matron\\r , emphatically.  \\'But don\\'t you think out-of-door relief a very bad\\r , thing, any way, Mr. Bumble?  You\\'re a gentleman of experience, and\\r , ought to know.  Come.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Mrs. Corney,\\' said the beadle, smiling as men smile who are conscious\\r , of superior information, \\'out-of-door relief, properly managed:\\r , properly managed, ma\\'am: is the porochial safeguard.  The great\\r , principle of out-of-door relief is, to give the paupers exactly what\\r , they don\\'t want; and then they get tired of coming.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Dear me!\\' exclaimed Mrs. Corney.  \\'Well, that is a good one, too!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes.  Betwixt you and me, ma\\'am,\\' returned Mr. Bumble, \\'that\\'s the\\r , great principle; and that\\'s the reason why, if you look at any cases\\r , that get into them owdacious newspapers, you\\'ll always observe that\\r , sick families have been relieved with slices of cheese.  That\\'s the\\r , rule now, Mrs. Corney, all over the country. But, however,\\' said the\\r , beadle, stopping to unpack his bundle, \\'these are official secrets,\\r , ma\\'am; not to be spoken of; except, as I may say, among the porochial\\r , officers, such as ourselves. This is the port wine, ma\\'am, that the\\r , board ordered for the infirmary; real, fresh, genuine port wine; only\\r , out of the cask this forenoon; clear as a bell, and no sediment!\\'\\r , \\r , Having held the first bottle up to the light, and shaken it well to\\r , test its excellence, Mr. Bumble placed them both on top of a chest of\\r , drawers; folded the handkerchief in which they had been wrapped; put it\\r , carefully in his pocket; and took up his hat, as if to go.\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'ll have a very cold walk, Mr. Bumble,\\' said the matron.\\r , \\r , \\'It blows, ma\\'am,\\' replied Mr. Bumble, turning up his coat-collar,\\r , \\'enough to cut one\\'s ears off.\\'\\r , \\r , The matron looked, from the little kettle, to the beadle, who was\\r , moving towards the door; and as the beadle coughed, preparatory to\\r , bidding her good-night, bashfully inquired whether--whether he wouldn\\'t\\r , take a cup of tea?\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble instantaneously turned back his collar again; laid his hat\\r , and stick upon a chair; and drew another chair up to the table.  As he\\r , slowly seated himself, he looked at the lady.  She fixed her eyes upon\\r , the little teapot.  Mr. Bumble coughed again, and slightly smiled.\\r , \\r , Mrs. Corney rose to get another cup and saucer from the closet. As she\\r , sat down, her eyes once again encountered those of the gallant beadle;\\r , she coloured, and applied herself to the task of making his tea.  Again\\r , Mr. Bumble coughed--louder this time than he had coughed yet.\\r , \\r , \\'Sweet?  Mr. Bumble?\\' inquired the matron, taking up the sugar-basin.\\r , \\r , \\'Very sweet, indeed, ma\\'am,\\' replied Mr. Bumble.  He fixed his eyes on\\r , Mrs. Corney as he said this; and if ever a beadle looked tender, Mr.\\r , Bumble was that beadle at that moment.\\r , \\r , The tea was made, and handed in silence.  Mr. Bumble, having spread a\\r , handkerchief over his knees to prevent the crumbs from sullying the\\r , splendour of his shorts, began to eat and drink; varying these\\r , amusements, occasionally, by fetching a deep sigh; which, however, had\\r , no injurious effect upon his appetite, but, on the contrary, rather\\r , seemed to facilitate his operations in the tea and toast department.\\r , \\r , \\'You have a cat, ma\\'am, I see,\\' said Mr. Bumble, glancing at one who,\\r , in the centre of her family, was basking before the fire; \\'and kittens\\r , too, I declare!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I am so fond of them, Mr. Bumble, you can\\'t think,\\' replied the\\r , matron.  \\'They\\'re _so_ happy, _so_ frolicsome, and _so_ cheerful, that\\r , they are quite companions for me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Very nice animals, ma\\'am,\\' replied Mr. Bumble, approvingly; \\'so very\\r , domestic.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, yes!\\' rejoined the matron with enthusiasm; \\'so fond of their home\\r , too, that it\\'s quite a pleasure, I\\'m sure.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Mrs. Corney, ma\\'am,\\' said Mr. Bumble, slowly, and marking the time\\r , with his teaspoon, \\'I mean to say this, ma\\'am; that any cat, or kitten,\\r , that could live with you, ma\\'am, and _not_ be fond of its home, must be\\r , a ass, ma\\'am.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, Mr. Bumble!\\' remonstrated Mrs. Corney.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s of no use disguising facts, ma\\'am,\\' said Mr. Bumble, slowly\\r , flourishing the teaspoon with a kind of amorous dignity which made him\\r , doubly impressive; \\'I would drown it myself, with pleasure.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then you\\'re a cruel man,\\' said the matron vivaciously, as she held out\\r , her hand for the beadle\\'s cup; \\'and a very hard-hearted man besides.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hard-hearted, ma\\'am?\\' said Mr. Bumble.  \\'Hard?\\'  Mr. Bumble resigned\\r , his cup without another word; squeezed Mrs. Corney\\'s little finger as\\r , she took it; and inflicting two open-handed slaps upon his laced\\r , waistcoat, gave a mighty sigh, and hitched his chair a very little\\r , morsel farther from the fire.\\r , \\r , It was a round table; and as Mrs. Corney and Mr. Bumble had been\\r , sitting opposite each other, with no great space between them, and\\r , fronting the fire, it will be seen that Mr. Bumble, in receding from\\r , the fire, and still keeping at the table, increased the distance\\r , between himself and Mrs. Corney; which proceeding, some prudent readers\\r , will doubtless be disposed to admire, and to consider an act of great\\r , heroism on Mr. Bumble\\'s part:  he being in some sort tempted by time,\\r , place, and opportunity, to give utterance to certain soft nothings,\\r , which however well they may become the lips of the light and\\r , thoughtless, do seem immeasurably beneath the dignity of judges of the\\r , land, members of parliament, ministers of state, lord mayors, and other\\r , great public functionaries, but more particularly beneath the\\r , stateliness and gravity of a beadle:  who (as is well known) should be\\r , the sternest and most inflexible among them all.\\r , \\r , Whatever were Mr. Bumble\\'s intentions, however (and no doubt they were\\r , of the best): it unfortunately happened, as has been twice before\\r , remarked, that the table was a round one; consequently Mr. Bumble,\\r , moving his chair by little and little, soon began to diminish the\\r , distance between himself and the matron; and, continuing to travel\\r , round the outer edge of the circle, brought his chair, in time, close\\r , to that in which the matron was seated.\\r , \\r , Indeed, the two chairs touched; and when they did so, Mr. Bumble\\r , stopped.\\r , \\r , Now, if the matron had moved her chair to the right, she would have\\r , been scorched by the fire; and if to the left, she must have fallen\\r , into Mr. Bumble\\'s arms; so (being a discreet matron, and no doubt\\r , foreseeing these consequences at a glance) she remained where she was,\\r , and handed Mr. Bumble another cup of tea.\\r , \\r , \\'Hard-hearted, Mrs. Corney?\\' said Mr. Bumble, stirring his tea, and\\r , looking up into the matron\\'s face; \\'are _you_ hard-hearted, Mrs.\\r , Corney?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Dear me!\\' exclaimed the matron, \\'what a very curious question from a\\r , single man.  What can you want to know for, Mr. Bumble?\\'\\r , \\r , The beadle drank his tea to the last drop; finished a piece of toast;\\r , whisked the crumbs off his knees; wiped his lips; and deliberately\\r , kissed the matron.\\r , \\r , \\'Mr. Bumble!\\' cried that discreet lady in a whisper; for the fright was\\r , so great, that she had quite lost her voice, \\'Mr. Bumble, I shall\\r , scream!\\'  Mr. Bumble made no reply; but in a slow and dignified manner,\\r , put his arm round the matron\\'s waist.\\r , \\r , As the lady had stated her intention of screaming, of course she would\\r , have screamed at this additional boldness, but that the exertion was\\r , rendered unnecessary by a hasty knocking at the door:  which was no\\r , sooner heard, than Mr. Bumble darted, with much agility, to the wine\\r , bottles, and began dusting them with great violence:  while the matron\\r , sharply demanded who was there.\\r , \\r , It is worthy of remark, as a curious physical instance of the efficacy\\r , of a sudden surprise in counteracting the effects of extreme fear, that\\r , her voice had quite recovered all its official asperity.\\r , \\r , \\'If you please, mistress,\\' said a withered old female pauper, hideously\\r , ugly:  putting her head in at the door, \\'Old Sally is a-going fast.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, what\\'s that to me?\\' angrily demanded the matron.  \\'I can\\'t keep\\r , her alive, can I?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, no, mistress,\\' replied the old woman, \\'nobody can; she\\'s far\\r , beyond the reach of help.  I\\'ve seen a many people die; little babes\\r , and great strong men; and I know when death\\'s a-coming, well enough.\\r , But she\\'s troubled in her mind: and when the fits are not on her,--and\\r , that\\'s not often, for she is dying very hard,--she says she has got\\r , something to tell, which you must hear.  She\\'ll never die quiet till\\r , you come, mistress.\\'\\r , \\r , At this intelligence, the worthy Mrs. Corney muttered a variety of\\r , invectives against old women who couldn\\'t even die without purposely\\r , annoying their betters; and, muffling herself in a thick shawl which\\r , she hastily caught up, briefly requested Mr. Bumble to stay till she\\r , came back, lest anything particular should occur.  Bidding the\\r , messenger walk fast, and not be all night hobbling up the stairs, she\\r , followed her from the room with a very ill grace, scolding all the way.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble\\'s conduct on being left to himself, was rather inexplicable.\\r , He opened the closet, counted the teaspoons, weighed the sugar-tongs,\\r , closely inspected a silver milk-pot to ascertain that it was of the\\r , genuine metal, and, having satisfied his curiosity on these points, put\\r , on his cocked hat corner-wise, and danced with much gravity four\\r , distinct times round the table.\\r , \\r , Having gone through this very extraordinary performance, he took off\\r , the cocked hat again, and, spreading himself before the fire with his\\r , back towards it, seemed to be mentally engaged in taking an exact\\r , inventory of the furniture.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXIV\\r , \\r , TREATS ON A VERY POOR SUBJECT.  BUT IS A SHORT ONE, AND MAY BE FOUND OF\\r , IMPORTANCE IN THIS HISTORY\\r , \\r , It was no unfit messenger of death, who had disturbed the quiet of the\\r , matron\\'s room.  Her body was bent by age; her limbs trembled with\\r , palsy; her face, distorted into a mumbling leer, resembled more the\\r , grotesque shaping of some wild pencil, than the work of Nature\\'s hand.\\r , \\r , Alas!  How few of Nature\\'s faces are left alone to gladden us with\\r , their beauty!  The cares, and sorrows, and hungerings, of the world,\\r , change them as they change hearts; and it is only when those passions\\r , sleep, and have lost their hold for ever, that the troubled clouds pass\\r , off, and leave Heaven\\'s surface clear.  It is a common thing for the\\r , countenances of the dead, even in that fixed and rigid state, to\\r , subside into the long-forgotten expression of sleeping infancy, and\\r , settle into the very look of early life; so calm, so peaceful, do they\\r , grow again, that those who knew them in their happy childhood, kneel by\\r , the coffin\\'s side in awe, and see the Angel even upon earth.\\r , \\r , The old crone tottered along the passages, and up the stairs, muttering\\r , some indistinct answers to the chidings of her companion; being at\\r , length compelled to pause for breath, she gave the light into her hand,\\r , and remained behind to follow as she might: while the more nimble\\r , superior made her way to the room where the sick woman lay.\\r , \\r , It was a bare garret-room, with a dim light burning at the farther end.\\r , There was another old woman watching by the bed; the parish\\r , apothecary\\'s apprentice was standing by the fire, making a toothpick\\r , out of a quill.\\r , \\r , \\'Cold night, Mrs. Corney,\\' said this young gentleman, as the matron\\r , entered.\\r , \\r , \\'Very cold, indeed, sir,\\' replied the mistress, in her most civil\\r , tones, and dropping a curtsey as she spoke.\\r , \\r , \\'You should get better coals out of your contractors,\\' said the\\r , apothecary\\'s deputy, breaking a lump on the top of the fire with the\\r , rusty poker; \\'these are not at all the sort of thing for a cold night.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'They\\'re the board\\'s choosing, sir,\\' returned the matron. \\'The least\\r , they could do, would be to keep us pretty warm:  for our places are\\r , hard enough.\\'\\r , \\r , The conversation was here interrupted by a moan from the sick woman.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh!\\' said the young mag, turning his face towards the bed, as if he\\r , had previously quite forgotten the patient, \\'it\\'s all U.P. there, Mrs.\\r , Corney.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It is, is it, sir?\\' asked the matron.\\r , \\r , \\'If she lasts a couple of hours, I shall be surprised,\\' said the\\r , apothecary\\'s apprentice, intent upon the toothpick\\'s point. \\'It\\'s a\\r , break-up of the system altogether.  Is she dozing, old lady?\\'\\r , \\r , The attendant stooped over the bed, to ascertain; and nodded in the\\r , affirmative.\\r , \\r , \\'Then perhaps she\\'ll go off in that way, if you don\\'t make a row,\\' said\\r , the young man.  \\'Put the light on the floor.  She won\\'t see it there.\\'\\r , \\r , The attendant did as she was told:  shaking her head meanwhile, to\\r , intimate that the woman would not die so easily; having done so, she\\r , resumed her seat by the side of the other nurse, who had by this time\\r , returned.  The mistress, with an expression of impatience, wrapped\\r , herself in her shawl, and sat at the foot of the bed.\\r , \\r , The apothecary\\'s apprentice, having completed the manufacture of the\\r , toothpick, planted himself in front of the fire and made good use of it\\r , for ten minutes or so:  when apparently growing rather dull, he wished\\r , Mrs. Corney joy of her job, and took himself off on tiptoe.\\r , \\r , When they had sat in silence for some time, the two old women rose from\\r , the bed, and crouching over the fire, held out their withered hands to\\r , catch the heat.  The flame threw a ghastly light on their shrivelled\\r , faces, and made their ugliness appear terrible, as, in this position,\\r , they began to converse in a low voice.\\r , \\r , \\'Did she say any more, Anny dear, while I was gone?\\' inquired the\\r , messenger.\\r , \\r , \\'Not a word,\\' replied the other.  \\'She plucked and tore at her arms for\\r , a little time; but I held her hands, and she soon dropped off.  She\\r , hasn\\'t much strength in her, so I easily kept her quiet.  I ain\\'t so\\r , weak for an old woman, although I am on parish allowance; no, no!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Did she drink the hot wine the doctor said she was to have?\\' demanded\\r , the first.\\r , \\r , \\'I tried to get it down,\\' rejoined the other.  \\'But her teeth were\\r , tight set, and she clenched the mug so hard that it was as much as I\\r , could do to get it back again.  So I drank it; and it did me good!\\'\\r , \\r , Looking cautiously round, to ascertain that they were not overheard,\\r , the two hags cowered nearer to the fire, and chuckled heartily.\\r , \\r , \\'I mind the time,\\' said the first speaker, \\'when she would have done\\r , the same, and made rare fun of it afterwards.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ay, that she would,\\' rejoined the other; \\'she had a merry heart. \\'A\\r , many, many, beautiful corpses she laid out, as nice and neat as\\r , waxwork.  My old eyes have seen them--ay, and those old hands touched\\r , them too; for I have helped her, scores of times.\\'\\r , \\r , Stretching forth her trembling fingers as she spoke, the old creature\\r , shook them exultingly before her face, and fumbling in her pocket,\\r , brought out an old time-discoloured tin snuff-box, from which she shook\\r , a few grains into the outstretched palm of her companion, and a few\\r , more into her own.  While they were thus employed, the matron, who had\\r , been impatiently watching until the dying woman should awaken from her\\r , stupor, joined them by the fire, and sharply asked how long she was to\\r , wait?\\r , \\r , \\'Not long, mistress,\\' replied the second woman, looking up into her\\r , face.  \\'We have none of us long to wait for Death.  Patience, patience!\\r , He\\'ll be here soon enough for us all.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hold your tongue, you doting idiot!\\' said the matron sternly. \\'You,\\r , Martha, tell me; has she been in this way before?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Often,\\' answered the first woman.\\r , \\r , \\'But will never be again,\\' added the second one; \\'that is, she\\'ll never\\r , wake again but once--and mind, mistress, that won\\'t be for long!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Long or short,\\' said the matron, snappishly, \\'she won\\'t find me here\\r , when she does wake; take care, both of you, how you worry me again for\\r , nothing.  It\\'s no part of my duty to see all the old women in the house\\r , die, and I won\\'t--that\\'s more. Mind that, you impudent old harridans.\\r , If you make a fool of me again, I\\'ll soon cure you, I warrant you!\\'\\r , \\r , She was bouncing away, when a cry from the two women, who had turned\\r , towards the bed, caused her to look round.  The patient had raised\\r , herself upright, and was stretching her arms towards them.\\r , \\r , \\'Who\\'s that?\\' she cried, in a hollow voice.\\r , \\r , \\'Hush, hush!\\' said one of the women, stooping over her.  \\'Lie down, lie\\r , down!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ll never lie down again alive!\\' said the woman, struggling. \\'I\\r , _will_ tell her!  Come here!  Nearer!  Let me whisper in your ear.\\'\\r , \\r , She clutched the matron by the arm, and forcing her into a chair by the\\r , bedside, was about to speak, when looking round, she caught sight of\\r , the two old women bending forward in the attitude of eager listeners.\\r , \\r , \\'Turn them away,\\' said the woman, drowsily; \\'make haste! make haste!\\'\\r , \\r , The two old crones, chiming in together, began pouring out many piteous\\r , lamentations that the poor dear was too far gone to know her best\\r , friends; and were uttering sundry protestations that they would never\\r , leave her, when the superior pushed them from the room, closed the\\r , door, and returned to the bedside.  On being excluded, the old ladies\\r , changed their tone, and cried through the keyhole that old Sally was\\r , drunk; which, indeed, was not unlikely; since, in addition to a\\r , moderate dose of opium prescribed by the apothecary, she was labouring\\r , under the effects of a final taste of gin-and-water which had been\\r , privily administered, in the openness of their hearts, by the worthy\\r , old ladies themselves.\\r , \\r , \\'Now listen to me,\\' said the dying woman aloud, as if making a great\\r , effort to revive one latent spark of energy.  \\'In this very room--in\\r , this very bed--I once nursed a pretty young creetur\\', that was brought\\r , into the house with her feet cut and bruised with walking, and all\\r , soiled with dust and blood.  She gave birth to a boy, and died.  Let me\\r , think--what was the year again!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Never mind the year,\\' said the impatient auditor; \\'what about her?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ay,\\' murmured the sick woman, relapsing into her former drowsy state,\\r , \\'what about her?--what about--I know!\\' she cried, jumping fiercely up:\\r , her face flushed, and her eyes starting from her head--\\'I robbed her,\\r , so I did!  She wasn\\'t cold--I tell you she wasn\\'t cold, when I stole\\r , it!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Stole what, for God\\'s sake?\\' cried the matron, with a gesture as if\\r , she would call for help.\\r , \\r , \\'_It_!\\' replied the woman, laying her hand over the other\\'s mouth. \\'The\\r , only thing she had.  She wanted clothes to keep her warm, and food to\\r , eat; but she had kept it safe, and had it in her bosom.  It was gold, I\\r , tell you!  Rich gold, that might have saved her life!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Gold!\\' echoed the matron, bending eagerly over the woman as she fell\\r , back.  \\'Go on, go on--yes--what of it?  Who was the mother? When was\\r , it?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'She charged me to keep it safe,\\' replied the woman with a groan, \\'and\\r , trusted me as the only woman about her.  I stole it in my heart when\\r , she first showed it me hanging round her neck; and the child\\'s death,\\r , perhaps, is on me besides!  They would have treated him better, if they\\r , had known it all!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Known what?\\' asked the other.  \\'Speak!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The boy grew so like his mother,\\' said the woman, rambling on, and not\\r , heeding the question, \\'that I could never forget it when I saw his\\r , face.  Poor girl! poor girl!  She was so young, too! Such a gentle\\r , lamb!  Wait; there\\'s more to tell.  I have not told you all, have I?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, no,\\' replied the matron, inclining her head to catch the words, as\\r , they came more faintly from the dying woman.  \\'Be quick, or it may be\\r , too late!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The mother,\\' said the woman, making a more violent effort than before;\\r , \\'the mother, when the pains of death first came upon her, whispered in\\r , my ear that if her baby was born alive, and thrived, the day might come\\r , when it would not feel so much disgraced to hear its poor young mother\\r , named. \"And oh, kind Heaven!\" she said, folding her thin hands\\r , together, \"whether it be boy or girl, raise up some friends for it in\\r , this troubled world, and take pity upon a lonely desolate child,\\r , abandoned to its mercy!\"\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The boy\\'s name?\\' demanded the matron.\\r , \\r , \\'They _called_ him Oliver,\\' replied the woman, feebly.  \\'The gold I\\r , stole was--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, yes--what?\\' cried the other.\\r , \\r , She was bending eagerly over the woman to hear her reply; but drew\\r , back, instinctively, as she once again rose, slowly and stiffly, into a\\r , sitting posture; then, clutching the coverlid with both hands, muttered\\r , some indistinct sounds in her throat, and fell lifeless on the bed.\\r , \\r ,       *      *      *      *      *\\r , \\r , \\'Stone dead!\\' said one of the old women, hurrying in as soon as the\\r , door was opened.\\r , \\r , \\'And nothing to tell, after all,\\' rejoined the matron, walking\\r , carelessly away.\\r , \\r , The two crones, to all appearance, too busily occupied in the\\r , preparations for their dreadful duties to make any reply, were left\\r , alone, hovering about the body.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXV\\r , \\r , WHEREIN THIS HISTORY REVERTS TO MR. FAGIN AND COMPANY\\r , \\r , While these things were passing in the country workhouse, Mr. Fagin sat\\r , in the old den--the same from which Oliver had been removed by the\\r , girl--brooding over a dull, smoky fire.  He held a pair of bellows upon\\r , his knee, with which he had apparently been endeavouring to rouse it\\r , into more cheerful action; but he had fallen into deep thought; and\\r , with his arms folded on them, and his chin resting on his thumbs, fixed\\r , his eyes, abstractedly, on the rusty bars.\\r , \\r , At a table behind him sat the Artful Dodger, Master Charles Bates, and\\r , Mr. Chitling: all intent upon a game of whist; the Artful taking dummy\\r , against Master Bates and Mr. Chitling.  The countenance of the\\r , first-named gentleman, peculiarly intelligent at all times, acquired\\r , great additional interest from his close observance of the game, and\\r , his attentive perusal of Mr. Chitling\\'s hand; upon which, from time to\\r , time, as occasion served, he bestowed a variety of earnest glances:\\r , wisely regulating his own play by the result of his observations upon\\r , his neighbour\\'s cards.  It being a cold night, the Dodger wore his hat,\\r , as, indeed, was often his custom within doors.  He also sustained a\\r , clay pipe between his teeth, which he only removed for a brief space\\r , when he deemed it necessary to apply for refreshment to a quart pot\\r , upon the table, which stood ready filled with gin-and-water for the\\r , accommodation of the company.\\r , \\r , Master Bates was also attentive to the play; but being of a more\\r , excitable nature than his accomplished friend, it was observable that\\r , he more frequently applied himself to the gin-and-water, and moreover\\r , indulged in many jests and irrelevant remarks, all highly unbecoming a\\r , scientific rubber.  Indeed, the Artful, presuming upon their close\\r , attachment, more than once took occasion to reason gravely with his\\r , companion upon these improprieties; all of which remonstrances, Master\\r , Bates received in extremely good part; merely requesting his friend to\\r , be \\'blowed,\\' or to insert his head in a sack, or replying with some\\r , other neatly-turned witticism of a similar kind, the happy application\\r , of which, excited considerable admiration in the mind of Mr. Chitling.\\r , It was remarkable that the latter gentleman and his partner invariably\\r , lost; and that the circumstance, so far from angering Master Bates,\\r , appeared to afford him the highest amusement, inasmuch as he laughed\\r , most uproariously at the end of every deal, and protested that he had\\r , never seen such a jolly game in all his born days.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s two doubles and the rub,\\' said Mr. Chitling, with a very long\\r , face, as he drew half-a-crown from his waistcoat-pocket.  \\'I never see\\r , such a feller as you, Jack; you win everything.  Even when we\\'ve good\\r , cards, Charley and I can\\'t make nothing of \\'em.\\'\\r , \\r , Either the master or the manner of this remark, which was made very\\r , ruefully, delighted Charley Bates so much, that his consequent shout of\\r , laughter roused the Jew from his reverie, and induced him to inquire\\r , what was the matter.\\r , \\r , \\'Matter, Fagin!\\' cried Charley.  \\'I wish you had watched the play.\\r , Tommy Chitling hasn\\'t won a point; and I went partners with him against\\r , the Artfull and dumb.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ay, ay!\\' said the Jew, with a grin, which sufficiently demonstrated\\r , that he was at no loss to understand the reason. \\'Try \\'em again, Tom;\\r , try \\'em again.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No more of it for me, thank \\'ee, Fagin,\\' replied Mr. Chitling; \\'I\\'ve\\r , had enough.  That \\'ere Dodger has such a run of luck that there\\'s no\\r , standing again\\' him.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ha! ha! my dear,\\' replied the Jew, \\'you must get up very early in the\\r , morning, to win against the Dodger.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Morning!\\' said Charley Bates; \\'you must put your boots on over-night,\\r , and have a telescope at each eye, and a opera-glass between your\\r , shoulders, if you want to come over him.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Dawkins received these handsome compliments with much philosophy,\\r , and offered to cut any gentleman in company, for the first\\r , picture-card, at a shilling at a time.  Nobody accepting the challenge,\\r , and his pipe being by this time smoked out, he proceeded to amuse\\r , himself by sketching a ground-plan of Newgate on the table with the\\r , piece of chalk which had served him in lieu of counters; whistling,\\r , meantime, with peculiar shrillness.\\r , \\r , \\'How precious dull you are, Tommy!\\' said the Dodger, stopping short\\r , when there had been a long silence; and addressing Mr. Chitling.  \\'What\\r , do you think he\\'s thinking of, Fagin?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'How should I know, my dear?\\' replied the Jew, looking round as he\\r , plied the bellows.  \\'About his losses, maybe; or the little retirement\\r , in the country that he\\'s just left, eh?  Ha! ha!  Is that it, my dear?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not a bit of it,\\' replied the Dodger, stopping the subject of\\r , discourse as Mr. Chitling was about to reply.  \\'What do _you_ say,\\r , Charley?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'_I_ should say,\\' replied Master Bates, with a grin, \\'that he was\\r , uncommon sweet upon Betsy.  See how he\\'s a-blushing!  Oh, my eye!\\r , here\\'s a merry-go-rounder!  Tommy Chitling\\'s in love!  Oh, Fagin,\\r , Fagin! what a spree!\\'\\r , \\r , Thoroughly overpowered with the notion of Mr. Chitling being the victim\\r , of the tender passion, Master Bates threw himself back in his chair\\r , with such violence, that he lost his balance, and pitched over upon the\\r , floor; where (the accident abating nothing of his merriment) he lay at\\r , full length until his laugh was over, when he resumed his former\\r , position, and began another laugh.\\r , \\r , \\'Never mind him, my dear,\\' said the Jew, winking at Mr. Dawkins, and\\r , giving Master Bates a reproving tap with the nozzle of the bellows.\\r , \\'Betsy\\'s a fine girl.  Stick up to her, Tom.  Stick up to her.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What I mean to say, Fagin,\\' replied Mr. Chitling, very red in the\\r , face, \\'is, that that isn\\'t anything to anybody here.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No more it is,\\' replied the Jew; \\'Charley will talk.  Don\\'t mind him,\\r , my dear; don\\'t mind him.  Betsy\\'s a fine girl.  Do as she bids you,\\r , Tom, and you will make your fortune.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'So I _do_ do as she bids me,\\' replied Mr. Chitling; \\'I shouldn\\'t have\\r , been milled, if it hadn\\'t been for her advice.  But it turned out a\\r , good job for you; didn\\'t it, Fagin!  And what\\'s six weeks of it?  It\\r , must come, some time or another, and why not in the winter time when\\r , you don\\'t want to go out a-walking so much; eh, Fagin?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah, to be sure, my dear,\\' replied the Jew.\\r , \\r , \\'You wouldn\\'t mind it again, Tom, would you,\\' asked the Dodger, winking\\r , upon Charley and the Jew, \\'if Bet was all right?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I mean to say that I shouldn\\'t,\\' replied Tom, angrily. \\'There, now.\\r , Ah!  Who\\'ll say as much as that, I should like to know; eh, Fagin?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nobody, my dear,\\' replied the Jew; \\'not a soul, Tom.  I don\\'t know one\\r , of \\'em that would do it besides you; not one of \\'em, my dear.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I might have got clear off, if I\\'d split upon her; mightn\\'t I, Fagin?\\'\\r , angrily pursued the poor half-witted dupe.  \\'A word from me would have\\r , done it; wouldn\\'t it, Fagin?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'To be sure it would, my dear,\\' replied the Jew.\\r , \\r , \\'But I didn\\'t blab it; did I, Fagin?\\' demanded Tom, pouring question\\r , upon question with great volubility.\\r , \\r , \\'No, no, to be sure,\\' replied the Jew; \\'you were too stout-hearted for\\r , that.  A deal too stout, my dear!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Perhaps I was,\\' rejoined Tom, looking round; \\'and if I was, what\\'s to\\r , laugh at, in that; eh, Fagin?\\'\\r , \\r , The Jew, perceiving that Mr. Chitling was considerably roused, hastened\\r , to assure him that nobody was laughing; and to prove the gravity of the\\r , company, appealed to Master Bates, the principal offender.  But,\\r , unfortunately, Charley, in opening his mouth to reply that he was never\\r , more serious in his life, was unable to prevent the escape of such a\\r , violent roar, that the abused Mr. Chitling, without any preliminary\\r , ceremonies, rushed across the room and aimed a blow at the offender;\\r , who, being skilful in evading pursuit, ducked to avoid it, and chose\\r , his time so well that it lighted on the chest of the merry old\\r , gentleman, and caused him to stagger to the wall, where he stood\\r , panting for breath, while Mr. Chitling looked on in intense dismay.\\r , \\r , \\'Hark!\\' cried the Dodger at this moment, \\'I heard the tinkler.\\'\\r , Catching up the light, he crept softly upstairs.\\r , \\r , The bell was rung again, with some impatience, while the party were in\\r , darkness.  After a short pause, the Dodger reappeared, and whispered\\r , Fagin mysteriously.\\r , \\r , \\'What!\\' cried the Jew, \\'alone?\\'\\r , \\r , The Dodger nodded in the affirmative, and, shading the flame of the\\r , candle with his hand, gave Charley Bates a private intimation, in dumb\\r , show, that he had better not be funny just then.  Having performed this\\r , friendly office, he fixed his eyes on the Jew\\'s face, and awaited his\\r , directions.\\r , \\r , The old man bit his yellow fingers, and meditated for some seconds; his\\r , face working with agitation the while, as if he dreaded something, and\\r , feared to know the worst.  At length he raised his head.\\r , \\r , \\'Where is he?\\' he asked.\\r , \\r , The Dodger pointed to the floor above, and made a gesture, as if to\\r , leave the room.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' said the Jew, answering the mute inquiry; \\'bring him down. Hush!\\r , Quiet, Charley!  Gently, Tom!  Scarce, scarce!\\'\\r , \\r , This brief direction to Charley Bates, and his recent antagonist, was\\r , softly and immediately obeyed.  There was no sound of their whereabout,\\r , when the Dodger descended the stairs, bearing the light in his hand,\\r , and followed by a man in a coarse smock-frock; who, after casting a\\r , hurried glance round the room, pulled off a large wrapper which had\\r , concealed the lower portion of his face, and disclosed: all haggard,\\r , unwashed, and unshorn: the features of flash Toby Crackit.\\r , \\r , \\'How are you, Faguey?\\' said this worthy, nodding to the Jew. \\'Pop that\\r , shawl away in my castor, Dodger, so that I may know where to find it\\r , when I cut; that\\'s the time of day!  You\\'ll be a fine young cracksman\\r , afore the old file now.\\'\\r , \\r , With these words he pulled up the smock-frock; and, winding it round\\r , his middle, drew a chair to the fire, and placed his feet upon the hob.\\r , \\r , \\'See there, Faguey,\\' he said, pointing disconsolately to his top boots;\\r , \\'not a drop of Day and Martin since you know when; not a bubble of\\r , blacking, by Jove!   But don\\'t look at me in that way, man.  All in\\r , good time.  I can\\'t talk about business till I\\'ve eat and drank; so\\r , produce the sustainance, and let\\'s have a quiet fill-out for the first\\r , time these three days!\\'\\r , \\r , The Jew motioned to the Dodger to place what eatables there were, upon\\r , the table; and, seating himself opposite the housebreaker, waited his\\r , leisure.\\r , \\r , To judge from appearances, Toby was by no means in a hurry to open the\\r , conversation.  At first, the Jew contented himself with patiently\\r , watching his countenance, as if to gain from its expression some clue\\r , to the intelligence he brought; but in vain.\\r , \\r , He looked tired and worn, but there was the same complacent repose upon\\r , his features that they always wore:  and through dirt, and beard, and\\r , whisker, there still shone, unimpaired, the self-satisfied smirk of\\r , flash Toby Crackit. Then the Jew, in an agony of impatience, watched\\r , every morsel he put into his mouth; pacing up and down the room,\\r , meanwhile, in irrepressible excitement.  It was all of no use.  Toby\\r , continued to eat with the utmost outward indifference, until he could\\r , eat no more; then, ordering the Dodger out, he closed the door, mixed a\\r , glass of spirits and water, and composed himself for talking.\\r , \\r , \\'First and foremost, Faguey,\\' said Toby.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, yes!\\' interposed the Jew, drawing up his chair.\\r , \\r , Mr. Crackit stopped to take a draught of spirits and water, and to\\r , declare that the gin was excellent; then placing his feet against the\\r , low mantelpiece, so as to bring his boots to about the level of his\\r , eye, he quietly resumed.\\r , \\r , \\'First and foremost, Faguey,\\' said the housebreaker, \\'how\\'s Bill?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What!\\' screamed the Jew, starting from his seat.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, you don\\'t mean to say--\\' began Toby, turning pale.\\r , \\r , \\'Mean!\\' cried the Jew, stamping furiously on the ground. \\'Where are\\r , they?  Sikes and the boy!  Where are they?  Where have they been?\\r , Where are they hiding?  Why have they not been here?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The crack failed,\\' said Toby faintly.\\r , \\r , \\'I know it,\\' replied the Jew, tearing a newspaper from his pocket and\\r , pointing to it.  \\'What more?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'They fired and hit the boy.  We cut over the fields at the back, with\\r , him between us--straight as the crow flies--through hedge and ditch.\\r , They gave chase.  Damme! the whole country was awake, and the dogs upon\\r , us.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The boy!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Bill had him on his back, and scudded like the wind.  We stopped to\\r , take him between us; his head hung down, and he was cold. They were\\r , close upon our heels; every man for himself, and each from the gallows!\\r , We parted company, and left the youngster lying in a ditch.  Alive or\\r , dead, that\\'s all I know about him.\\'\\r , \\r , The Jew stopped to hear no more; but uttering a loud yell, and twining\\r , his hands in his hair, rushed from the room, and from the house.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXVI\\r , \\r , IN WHICH A MYSTERIOUS CHARACTER APPEARS UPON THE SCENE; AND MANY\\r , THINGS, INSEPARABLE FROM THIS HISTORY, ARE DONE AND PERFORMED\\r , \\r , The old man had gained the street corner, before he began to recover\\r , the effect of Toby Crackit\\'s intelligence.  He had relaxed nothing of\\r , his unusual speed; but was still pressing onward, in the same wild and\\r , disordered manner, when the sudden dashing past of a carriage: and a\\r , boisterous cry from the foot passengers, who saw his danger:  drove him\\r , back upon the pavement.  Avoiding, as much as was possible, all the\\r , main streets, and skulking only through the by-ways and alleys, he at\\r , length emerged on Snow Hill.  Here he walked even faster than before;\\r , nor did he linger until he had again turned into a court; when, as if\\r , conscious that he was now in his proper element, he fell into his usual\\r , shuffling pace, and seemed to breathe more freely.\\r , \\r , Near to the spot on which Snow Hill and Holborn Hill meet, opens, upon\\r , the right hand as you come out of the City, a narrow and dismal alley,\\r , leading to Saffron Hill.  In its filthy shops are exposed for sale huge\\r , bunches of second-hand silk handkerchiefs, of all sizes and patterns;\\r , for here reside the traders who purchase them from pick-pockets.\\r , Hundreds of these handkerchiefs hang dangling from pegs outside the\\r , windows or flaunting from the door-posts; and the shelves, within, are\\r , piled with them. Confined as the limits of Field Lane are, it has its\\r , barber, its coffee-shop, its beer-shop, and its fried-fish warehouse.\\r , It is a commercial colony of itself:  the emporium of petty larceny:\\r , visited at early morning, and setting-in of dusk, by silent merchants,\\r , who traffic in dark back-parlours, and who go as strangely as they\\r , come.  Here, the clothesman, the shoe-vamper, and the rag-merchant,\\r , display their goods, as sign-boards to the petty thief; here, stores of\\r , old iron and bones, and heaps of mildewy fragments of woollen-stuff and\\r , linen, rust and rot in the grimy cellars.\\r , \\r , It was into this place that the Jew turned.  He was well known to the\\r , sallow denizens of the lane; for such of them as were on the look-out\\r , to buy or sell, nodded, familiarly, as he passed along. He replied to\\r , their salutations in the same way; but bestowed no closer recognition\\r , until he reached the further end of the alley; when he stopped, to\\r , address a salesman of small stature, who had squeezed as much of his\\r , person into a child\\'s chair as the chair would hold, and was smoking a\\r , pipe at his warehouse door.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, the sight of you, Mr. Fagin, would cure the hoptalmy!\\' said this\\r , respectable trader, in acknowledgment of the Jew\\'s inquiry after his\\r , health.\\r , \\r , \\'The neighbourhood was a little too hot, Lively,\\' said Fagin, elevating\\r , his eyebrows, and crossing his hands upon his shoulders.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, I\\'ve heerd that complaint of it, once or twice before,\\' replied\\r , the trader; \\'but it soon cools down again; don\\'t you find it so?\\'\\r , \\r , Fagin nodded in the affirmative.  Pointing in the direction of Saffron\\r , Hill, he inquired whether any one was up yonder to-night.\\r , \\r , \\'At the Cripples?\\' inquired the man.\\r , \\r , The Jew nodded.\\r , \\r , \\'Let me see,\\' pursued the merchant, reflecting.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, there\\'s some half-dozen of \\'em gone in, that I knows. I don\\'t\\r , think your friend\\'s there.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Sikes is not, I suppose?\\' inquired the Jew, with a disappointed\\r , countenance.\\r , \\r , \\'_Non istwentus_, as the lawyers say,\\' replied the little man, shaking\\r , his head, and looking amazingly sly.  \\'Have you got anything in my line\\r , to-night?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing to-night,\\' said the Jew, turning away.\\r , \\r , \\'Are you going up to the Cripples, Fagin?\\' cried the little man,\\r , calling after him.  \\'Stop!  I don\\'t mind if I have a drop there with\\r , you!\\'\\r , \\r , But as the Jew, looking back, waved his hand to intimate that he\\r , preferred being alone; and, moreover, as the little man could not very\\r , easily disengage himself from the chair; the sign of the Cripples was,\\r , for a time, bereft of the advantage of Mr. Lively\\'s presence.  By the\\r , time he had got upon his legs, the Jew had disappeared; so Mr. Lively,\\r , after ineffectually standing on tiptoe, in the hope of catching sight\\r , of him, again forced himself into the little chair, and, exchanging a\\r , shake of the head with a lady in the opposite shop, in which doubt and\\r , mistrust were plainly mingled, resumed his pipe with a grave demeanour.\\r , \\r , The Three Cripples, or rather the Cripples; which was the sign by which\\r , the establishment was familiarly known to its patrons:  was the\\r , public-house in which Mr. Sikes and his dog have already figured.\\r , Merely making a sign to a man at the bar, Fagin walked straight\\r , upstairs, and opening the door of a room, and softly insinuating\\r , himself into the chamber, looked anxiously about: shading his eyes with\\r , his hand, as if in search of some particular person.\\r , \\r , The room was illuminated by two gas-lights; the glare of which was\\r , prevented by the barred shutters, and closely-drawn curtains of faded\\r , red, from being visible outside.  The ceiling was blackened, to prevent\\r , its colour from being injured by the flaring of the lamps; and the\\r , place was so full of dense tobacco smoke, that at first it was scarcely\\r , possible to discern anything more.  By degrees, however, as some of it\\r , cleared away through the open door, an assemblage of heads, as confused\\r , as the noises that greeted the ear, might be made out; and as the eye\\r , grew more accustomed to the scene, the spectator gradually became aware\\r , of the presence of a numerous company, male and female, crowded round a\\r , long table: at the upper end of which, sat a chairman with a hammer of\\r , office in his hand; while a professional gentleman with a bluish nose,\\r , and his face tied up for the benefit of a toothache, presided at a\\r , jingling piano in a remote corner.\\r , \\r , As Fagin stepped softly in, the professional gentleman, running over\\r , the keys by way of prelude, occasioned a general cry of order for a\\r , song; which having subsided, a young lady proceeded to entertain the\\r , company with a ballad in four verses, between each of which the\\r , accompanyist played the melody all through, as loud as he could.  When\\r , this was over, the chairman gave a sentiment, after which, the\\r , professional gentleman on the chairman\\'s right and left volunteered a\\r , duet, and sang it, with great applause.\\r , \\r , It was curious to observe some faces which stood out prominently from\\r , among the group.  There was the chairman himself, (the landlord of the\\r , house,) a coarse, rough, heavy built fellow, who, while the songs were\\r , proceeding, rolled his eyes hither and thither, and, seeming to give\\r , himself up to joviality, had an eye for everything that was done, and\\r , an ear for everything that was said--and sharp ones, too.  Near him\\r , were the singers: receiving, with professional indifference, the\\r , compliments of the company, and applying themselves, in turn, to a\\r , dozen proffered glasses of spirits and water, tendered by their more\\r , boisterous admirers; whose countenances, expressive of almost every\\r , vice in almost every grade, irresistibly attracted the attention, by\\r , their very repulsiveness.  Cunning, ferocity, and drunkeness in all its\\r , stages, were there, in their strongest aspect; and women: some with the\\r , last lingering tinge of their early freshness almost fading as you\\r , looked:  others with every mark and stamp of their sex utterly beaten\\r , out, and presenting but one loathsome blank of profligacy and crime;\\r , some mere girls, others but young women, and none past the prime of\\r , life; formed the darkest and saddest portion of this dreary picture.\\r , \\r , Fagin, troubled by no grave emotions, looked eagerly from face to face\\r , while these proceedings were in progress; but apparently without\\r , meeting that of which he was in search. Succeeding, at length, in\\r , catching the eye of the man who occupied the chair, he beckoned to him\\r , slightly, and left the room, as quietly as he had entered it.\\r , \\r , \\'What can I do for you, Mr. Fagin?\\' inquired the man, as he followed\\r , him out to the landing.  \\'Won\\'t you join us?  They\\'ll be delighted,\\r , every one of \\'em.\\'\\r , \\r , The Jew shook his head impatiently, and said in a whisper, \\'Is _he_\\r , here?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' replied the man.\\r , \\r , \\'And no news of Barney?\\' inquired Fagin.\\r , \\r , \\'None,\\' replied the landlord of the Cripples; for it was he. \\'He won\\'t\\r , stir till it\\'s all safe.  Depend on it, they\\'re on the scent down\\r , there; and that if he moved, he\\'d blow upon the thing at once.  He\\'s\\r , all right enough, Barney is, else I should have heard of him.  I\\'ll\\r , pound it, that Barney\\'s managing properly. Let him alone for that.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Will _he_ be here to-night?\\' asked the Jew, laying the same emphasis\\r , on the pronoun as before.\\r , \\r , \\'Monks, do you mean?\\' inquired the landlord, hesitating.\\r , \\r , \\'Hush!\\' said the Jew.  \\'Yes.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Certain,\\' replied the man, drawing a gold watch from his fob; \\'I\\r , expected him here before now.  If you\\'ll wait ten minutes, he\\'ll be--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, no,\\' said the Jew, hastily; as though, however desirous he might\\r , be to see the person in question, he was nevertheless relieved by his\\r , absence.  \\'Tell him I came here to see him; and that he must come to me\\r , to-night.  No, say to-morrow.  As he is not here, to-morrow will be\\r , time enough.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Good!\\' said the man.  \\'Nothing more?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not a word now,\\' said the Jew, descending the stairs.\\r , \\r , \\'I say,\\' said the other, looking over the rails, and speaking in a\\r , hoarse whisper; \\'what a time this would be for a sell!  I\\'ve got Phil\\r , Barker here: so drunk, that a boy might take him!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!  But it\\'s not Phil Barker\\'s time,\\' said the Jew, looking up.\\r , \\r , \\'Phil has something more to do, before we can afford to part with him;\\r , so go back to the company, my dear, and tell them to lead merry\\r , lives--_while they last_.  Ha! ha! ha!\\'\\r , \\r , The landlord reciprocated the old man\\'s laugh; and returned to his\\r , guests.  The Jew was no sooner alone, than his countenance resumed its\\r , former expression of anxiety and thought.  After a brief reflection, he\\r , called a hack-cabriolet, and bade the man drive towards Bethnal Green.\\r , He dismissed him within some quarter of a mile of Mr. Sikes\\'s\\r , residence, and performed the short remainder of the distance, on foot.\\r , \\r , \\'Now,\\' muttered the Jew, as he knocked at the door, \\'if there is any\\r , deep play here, I shall have it out of you, my girl, cunning as you\\r , are.\\'\\r , \\r , She was in her room, the woman said.  Fagin crept softly upstairs, and\\r , entered it without any previous ceremony.  The girl was alone; lying\\r , with her head upon the table, and her hair straggling over it.\\r , \\r , \\'She has been drinking,\\' thought the Jew, cooly, \\'or perhaps she is\\r , only miserable.\\'\\r , \\r , The old man turned to close the door, as he made this reflection; the\\r , noise thus occasioned, roused the girl.  She eyed his crafty face\\r , narrowly, as she inquired to his recital of Toby Crackit\\'s story.  When\\r , it was concluded, she sank into her former attitude, but spoke not a\\r , word.  She pushed the candle impatiently away; and once or twice as she\\r , feverishly changed her position, shuffled her feet upon the ground; but\\r , this was all.\\r , \\r , During the silence, the Jew looked restlessly about the room, as if to\\r , assure himself that there were no appearances of Sikes having covertly\\r , returned.  Apparently satisfied with his inspection, he coughed twice\\r , or thrice, and made as many efforts to open a conversation; but the\\r , girl heeded him no more than if he had been made of stone.  At length\\r , he made another attempt; and rubbing his hands together, said, in his\\r , most conciliatory tone,\\r , \\r , \\'And where should you think Bill was now, my dear?\\'\\r , \\r , The girl moaned out some half intelligible reply, that she could not\\r , tell; and seemed, from the smothered noise that escaped her, to be\\r , crying.\\r , \\r , \\'And the boy, too,\\' said the Jew, straining his eyes to catch a glimpse\\r , of her face.  \\'Poor leetle child!  Left in a ditch, Nance; only think!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The child,\\' said the girl, suddenly looking up, \\'is better where he\\r , is, than among us; and if no harm comes to Bill from it, I hope he lies\\r , dead in the ditch and that his young bones may rot there.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What!\\' cried the Jew, in amazement.\\r , \\r , \\'Ay, I do,\\' returned the girl, meeting his gaze.  \\'I shall be glad to\\r , have him away from my eyes, and to know that the worst is over.  I\\r , can\\'t bear to have him about me.  The sight of him turns me against\\r , myself, and all of you.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Pooh!\\' said the Jew, scornfully.  \\'You\\'re drunk.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Am I?\\' cried the girl bitterly.  \\'It\\'s no fault of yours, if I am not!\\r , You\\'d never have me anything else, if you had your will, except\\r , now;--the humour doesn\\'t suit you, doesn\\'t it?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No!\\' rejoined the Jew, furiously.  \\'It does not.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Change it, then!\\' responded the girl, with a laugh.\\r , \\r , \\'Change it!\\' exclaimed the Jew, exasperated beyond all bounds by his\\r , companion\\'s unexpected obstinacy, and the vexation of the night, \\'I\\r , _will_ change it!  Listen to me, you drab.  Listen to me, who with six\\r , words, can strangle Sikes as surely as if I had his bull\\'s throat\\r , between my fingers now.  If he comes back, and leaves the boy behind\\r , him; if he gets off free, and dead or alive, fails to restore him to\\r , me; murder him yourself if you would have him escape Jack Ketch.  And\\r , do it the moment he sets foot in this room, or mind me, it will be too\\r , late!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What is all this?\\' cried the girl involuntarily.\\r , \\r , \\'What is it?\\' pursued Fagin, mad with rage.  \\'When the boy\\'s worth\\r , hundreds of pounds to me, am I to lose what chance threw me in the way\\r , of getting safely, through the whims of a drunken gang that I could\\r , whistle away the lives of!  And me bound, too, to a born devil that\\r , only wants the will, and has the power to, to--\\'\\r , \\r , Panting for breath, the old man stammered for a word; and in that\\r , instant checked the torrent of his wrath, and changed his whole\\r , demeanour.  A moment before, his clenched hands had grasped the air;\\r , his eyes had dilated; and his face grown livid with passion; but now,\\r , he shrunk into a chair, and, cowering together, trembled with the\\r , apprehension of having himself disclosed some hidden villainy.  After a\\r , short silence, he ventured to look round at his companion.  He appeared\\r , somewhat reassured, on beholding her in the same listless attitude from\\r , which he had first roused her.\\r , \\r , \\'Nancy, dear!\\' croaked the Jew, in his usual voice.  \\'Did you mind me,\\r , dear?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t worry me now, Fagin!\\' replied the girl, raising her head\\r , languidly.  \\'If Bill has not done it this time, he will another. He has\\r , done many a good job for you, and will do many more when he can; and\\r , when he can\\'t he won\\'t; so no more about that.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Regarding this boy, my dear?\\' said the Jew, rubbing the palms of his\\r , hands nervously together.\\r , \\r , \\'The boy must take his chance with the rest,\\' interrupted Nancy,\\r , hastily; \\'and I say again, I hope he is dead, and out of harm\\'s way,\\r , and out of yours,--that is, if Bill comes to no harm.  And if Toby got\\r , clear off, Bill\\'s pretty sure to be safe; for Bill\\'s worth two of Toby\\r , any time.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And about what I was saying, my dear?\\' observed the Jew, keeping his\\r , glistening eye steadily upon her.\\r , \\r , \\'You must say it all over again, if it\\'s anything you want me to do,\\'\\r , rejoined Nancy; \\'and if it is, you had better wait till to-morrow.  You\\r , put me up for a minute; but now I\\'m stupid again.\\'\\r , \\r , Fagin put several other questions: all with the same drift of\\r , ascertaining whether the girl had profited by his unguarded hints; but,\\r , she answered them so readily, and was withal so utterly unmoved by his\\r , searching looks, that his original impression of her being more than a\\r , trifle in liquor, was confirmed.  Nancy, indeed, was not exempt from a\\r , failing which was very common among the Jew\\'s female pupils; and in\\r , which, in their tenderer years, they were rather encouraged than\\r , checked. Her disordered appearance, and a wholesale perfume of Geneva\\r , which pervaded the apartment, afforded strong confirmatory evidence of\\r , the justice of the Jew\\'s supposition; and when, after indulging in the\\r , temporary display of violence above described, she subsided, first into\\r , dullness, and afterwards into a compound of feelings: under the\\r , influence of which she shed tears one minute, and in the next gave\\r , utterance to various exclamations of \\'Never say die!\\' and divers\\r , calculations as to what might be the amount of the odds so long as a\\r , lady or gentleman was happy, Mr. Fagin, who had had considerable\\r , experience of such matters in his time, saw, with great satisfaction,\\r , that she was very far gone indeed.\\r , \\r , Having eased his mind by this discovery; and having accomplished his\\r , twofold object of imparting to the girl what he had, that night, heard,\\r , and of ascertaining, with his own eyes, that Sikes had not returned,\\r , Mr. Fagin again turned his face homeward: leaving his young friend\\r , asleep, with her head upon the table.\\r , \\r , It was within an hour of midnight.  The weather being dark, and\\r , piercing cold, he had no great temptation to loiter.  The sharp wind\\r , that scoured the streets, seemed to have cleared them of passengers, as\\r , of dust and mud, for few people were abroad, and they were to all\\r , appearance hastening fast home. It blew from the right quarter for the\\r , Jew, however, and straight before it he went: trembling, and shivering,\\r , as every fresh gust drove him rudely on his way.\\r , \\r , He had reached the corner of his own street, and was already fumbling\\r , in his pocket for the door-key, when a dark figure emerged from a\\r , projecting entrance which lay in deep shadow, and, crossing the road,\\r , glided up to him unperceived.\\r , \\r , \\'Fagin!\\' whispered a voice close to his ear.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!\\' said the Jew, turning quickly round, \\'is that--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes!\\' interrupted the stranger.  \\'I have been lingering here these two\\r , hours.  Where the devil have you been?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'On your business, my dear,\\' replied the Jew, glancing uneasily at his\\r , companion, and slackening his pace as he spoke.  \\'On your business all\\r , night.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, of course!\\' said the stranger, with a sneer.  \\'Well; and what\\'s\\r , come of it?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing good,\\' said the Jew.\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing bad, I hope?\\' said the stranger, stopping short, and turning a\\r , startled look on his companion.\\r , \\r , The Jew shook his head, and was about to reply, when the stranger,\\r , interrupting him, motioned to the house, before which they had by this\\r , time arrived:  remarking, that he had better say what he had got to\\r , say, under cover:  for his blood was chilled with standing about so\\r , long, and the wind blew through him.\\r , \\r , Fagin looked as if he could have willingly excused himself from taking\\r , home a visitor at that unseasonable hour; and, indeed, muttered\\r , something about having no fire; but his companion repeating his request\\r , in a peremptory manner, he unlocked the door, and requested him to\\r , close it softly, while he got a light.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s as dark as the grave,\\' said the man, groping forward a few steps.\\r , \\'Make haste!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Shut the door,\\' whispered Fagin from the end of the passage. As he\\r , spoke, it closed with a loud noise.\\r , \\r , \\'That wasn\\'t my doing,\\' said the other man, feeling his way. \\'The wind\\r , blew it to, or it shut of its own accord: one or the other. Look sharp\\r , with the light, or I shall knock my brains out against something in\\r , this confounded hole.\\'\\r , \\r , Fagin stealthily descended the kitchen stairs.  After a short absence,\\r , he returned with a lighted candle, and the intelligence that Toby\\r , Crackit was asleep in the back room below, and that the boys were in\\r , the front one.  Beckoning the man to follow him, he led the way\\r , upstairs.\\r , \\r , \\'We can say the few words we\\'ve got to say in here, my dear,\\' said the\\r , Jew, throwing open a door on the first floor; \\'and as there are holes\\r , in the shutters, and we never show lights to our neighbours, we\\'ll set\\r , the candle on the stairs.  There!\\'\\r , \\r , With those words, the Jew, stooping down, placed the candle on an upper\\r , flight of stairs, exactly opposite to the room door.  This done, he led\\r , the way into the apartment; which was destitute of all movables save a\\r , broken arm-chair, and an old couch or sofa without covering, which\\r , stood behind the door.  Upon this piece of furniture, the stranger sat\\r , himself with the air of a weary man; and the Jew, drawing up the\\r , arm-chair opposite, they sat face to face.  It was not quite dark; the\\r , door was partially open; and the candle outside, threw a feeble\\r , reflection on the opposite wall.\\r , \\r , They conversed for some time in whispers.  Though nothing of the\\r , conversation was distinguishable beyond a few disjointed words here and\\r , there, a listener might easily have perceived that Fagin appeared to be\\r , defending himself against some remarks of the stranger; and that the\\r , latter was in a state of considerable irritation.  They might have been\\r , talking, thus, for a quarter of an hour or more, when Monks--by which\\r , name the Jew had designated the strange man several times in the course\\r , of their colloquy--said, raising his voice a little,\\r , \\r , \\'I tell you again, it was badly planned.  Why not have kept him here\\r , among the rest, and made a sneaking, snivelling pickpocket of him at\\r , once?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Only hear him!\\' exclaimed the Jew, shrugging his shoulders.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, do you mean to say you couldn\\'t have done it, if you had chosen?\\'\\r , demanded Monks, sternly.  \\'Haven\\'t you done it, with other boys, scores\\r , of times?  If you had had patience for a twelvemonth, at most, couldn\\'t\\r , you have got him convicted, and sent safely out of the kingdom; perhaps\\r , for life?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Whose turn would that have served, my dear?\\' inquired the Jew humbly.\\r , \\r , \\'Mine,\\' replied Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'But not mine,\\' said the Jew, submissively.  \\'He might have become of\\r , use to me.  When there are two parties to a bargain, it is only\\r , reasonable that the interests of both should be consulted; is it, my\\r , good friend?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What then?\\' demanded Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'I saw it was not easy to train him to the business,\\' replied the Jew;\\r , \\'he was not like other boys in the same circumstances.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Curse him, no!\\' muttered the man, \\'or he would have been a thief, long\\r , ago.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I had no hold upon him to make him worse,\\' pursued the Jew, anxiously\\r , watching the countenance of his companion.  \\'His hand was not in.  I\\r , had nothing to frighten him with; which we always must have in the\\r , beginning, or we labour in vain.  What could I do?  Send him out with\\r , the Dodger and Charley?  We had enough of that, at first, my dear; I\\r , trembled for us all.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'_That_ was not my doing,\\' observed Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'No, no, my dear!\\' renewed the Jew.  \\'And I don\\'t quarrel with it now;\\r , because, if it had never happened, you might never have clapped eyes on\\r , the boy to notice him, and so led to the discovery that it was him you\\r , were looking for.  Well!  I got him back for you by means of the girl;\\r , and then _she_ begins to favour him.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Throttle the girl!\\' said Monks, impatiently.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, we can\\'t afford to do that just now, my dear,\\' replied the Jew,\\r , smiling; \\'and, besides, that sort of thing is not in our way; or, one\\r , of these days, I might be glad to have it done.  I know what these\\r , girls are, Monks, well.  As soon as the boy begins to harden, she\\'ll\\r , care no more for him, than for a block of wood.  You want him made a\\r , thief.  If he is alive, I can make him one from this time; and,\\r , if--if--\\' said the Jew, drawing nearer to the other,--\\'it\\'s not likely,\\r , mind,--but if the worst comes to the worst, and he is dead--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s no fault of mine if he is!\\' interposed the other man, with a look\\r , of terror, and clasping the Jew\\'s arm with trembling hands.  \\'Mind\\r , that.  Fagin!  I had no hand in it.  Anything but his death, I told you\\r , from the first.  I won\\'t shed blood; it\\'s always found out, and haunts\\r , a man besides.  If they shot him dead, I was not the cause; do you hear\\r , me?  Fire this infernal den!  What\\'s that?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What!\\' cried the Jew, grasping the coward round the body, with both\\r , arms, as he sprung to his feet.  \\'Where?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yonder! replied the man, glaring at the opposite wall.  \\'The shadow!\\r , I saw the shadow of a woman, in a cloak and bonnet, pass along the\\r , wainscot like a breath!\\'\\r , \\r , The Jew released his hold, and they rushed tumultuously from the room.\\r , The candle, wasted by the draught, was standing where it had been\\r , placed.  It showed them only the empty staircase, and their own white\\r , faces.  They listened intently:  a profound silence reigned throughout\\r , the house.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s your fancy,\\' said the Jew, taking up the light and turning to his\\r , companion.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ll swear I saw it!\\' replied Monks, trembling.  \\'It was bending\\r , forward when I saw it first; and when I spoke, it darted away.\\'\\r , \\r , The Jew glanced contemptuously at the pale face of his associate, and,\\r , telling him he could follow, if he pleased, ascended the stairs.  They\\r , looked into all the rooms; they were cold, bare, and empty.  They\\r , descended into the passage, and thence into the cellars below.  The\\r , green damp hung upon the low walls; the tracks of the snail and slug\\r , glistened in the light of the candle; but all was still as death.\\r , \\r , \\'What do you think now?\\' said the Jew, when they had regained the\\r , passage.  \\'Besides ourselves, there\\'s not a creature in the house\\r , except Toby and the boys; and they\\'re safe enough. See here!\\'\\r , \\r , As a proof of the fact, the Jew drew forth two keys from his pocket;\\r , and explained, that when he first went downstairs, he had locked them\\r , in, to prevent any intrusion on the conference.\\r , \\r , This accumulated testimony effectually staggered Mr. Monks. His\\r , protestations had gradually become less and less vehement as they\\r , proceeded in their search without making any discovery; and, now, he\\r , gave vent to several very grim laughs, and confessed it could only have\\r , been his excited imagination.  He declined any renewal of the\\r , conversation, however, for that night:  suddenly remembering that it\\r , was past one o\\'clock.  And so the amiable couple parted.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXVII\\r , \\r , ATONES FOR THE UNPOLITENESS OF A FORMER CHAPTER; WHICH DESERTED A LADY,\\r , MOST UNCEREMONIOUSLY\\r , \\r , As it would be, by no means, seemly in a humble author to keep so\\r , mighty a personage as a beadle waiting, with his back to the fire, and\\r , the skirts of his coat gathered up under his arms, until such time as\\r , it might suit his pleasure to relieve him; and as it would still less\\r , become his station, or his gallantry to involve in the same neglect a\\r , lady on whom that beadle had looked with an eye of tenderness and\\r , affection, and in whose ear he had whispered sweet words, which, coming\\r , from such a quarter, might well thrill the bosom of maid or matron of\\r , whatsoever degree; the historian whose pen traces these words--trusting\\r , that he knows his place, and that he entertains a becoming reverence\\r , for those upon earth to whom high and important authority is\\r , delegated--hastens to pay them that respect which their position\\r , demands, and to treat them with all that duteous ceremony which their\\r , exalted rank, and (by consequence) great virtues, imperatively claim at\\r , his hands.  Towards this end, indeed, he had purposed to introduce, in\\r , this place, a dissertation touching the divine right of beadles, and\\r , elucidative of the position, that a beadle can do no wrong:  which\\r , could not fail to have been both pleasurable and profitable to the\\r , right-minded reader but which he is unfortunately compelled, by want of\\r , time and space, to postpone to some more convenient and fitting\\r , opportunity; on the arrival of which, he will be prepared to show, that\\r , a beadle properly constituted:  that is to say, a parochial beadle,\\r , attached to a parochial workhouse, and attending in his official\\r , capacity the parochial church:  is, in right and virtue of his office,\\r , possessed of all the excellences and best qualities of humanity; and\\r , that to none of those excellences, can mere companies\\' beadles, or\\r , court-of-law beadles, or even chapel-of-ease beadles (save the last,\\r , and they in a very lowly and inferior degree), lay the remotest\\r , sustainable claim.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble had re-counted the teaspoons, re-weighed the sugar-tongs,\\r , made a closer inspection of the milk-pot, and ascertained to a nicety\\r , the exact condition of the furniture, down to the very horse-hair seats\\r , of the chairs; and had repeated each process full half a dozen times;\\r , before he began to think that it was time for Mrs. Corney to return.\\r , Thinking begets thinking; as there were no sounds of Mrs. Corney\\'s\\r , approach, it occured to Mr. Bumble that it would be an innocent and\\r , virtuous way of spending the time, if he were further to allay his\\r , curiousity by a cursory glance at the interior of Mrs. Corney\\'s chest\\r , of drawers.\\r , \\r , Having listened at the keyhole, to assure himself that nobody was\\r , approaching the chamber, Mr. Bumble, beginning at the bottom, proceeded\\r , to make himself acquainted with the contents of the three long drawers:\\r , which, being filled with various garments of good fashion and texture,\\r , carefully preserved between two layers of old newspapers, speckled with\\r , dried lavender: seemed to yield him exceeding satisfaction.  Arriving,\\r , in course of time, at the right-hand corner drawer (in which was the\\r , key), and beholding therein a small padlocked box, which, being shaken,\\r , gave forth a pleasant sound, as of the chinking of coin, Mr. Bumble\\r , returned with a stately walk to the fireplace; and, resuming his old\\r , attitude, said, with a grave and determined air, \\'I\\'ll do it!\\' He\\r , followed up this remarkable declaration, by shaking his head in a\\r , waggish manner for ten minutes, as though he were remonstrating with\\r , himself for being such a pleasant dog; and then, he took a view of his\\r , legs in profile, with much seeming pleasure and interest.\\r , \\r , He was still placidly engaged in this latter survey, when Mrs. Corney,\\r , hurrying into the room, threw herself, in a breathless state, on a\\r , chair by the fireside, and covering her eyes with one hand, placed the\\r , other over her heart, and gasped for breath.\\r , \\r , \\'Mrs. Corney,\\' said Mr. Bumble, stooping over the matron, \\'what is\\r , this, ma\\'am?  Has anything happened, ma\\'am?  Pray answer me: I\\'m\\r , on--on--\\' Mr. Bumble, in his alarm, could not immediately think of the\\r , word \\'tenterhooks,\\' so he said \\'broken bottles.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, Mr. Bumble!\\' cried the lady, \\'I have been so dreadfully put out!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Put out, ma\\'am!\\' exclaimed Mr. Bumble; \\'who has dared to--?  I know!\\'\\r , said Mr. Bumble, checking himself, with native majesty, \\'this is them\\r , wicious paupers!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s dreadful to think of!\\' said the lady, shuddering.\\r , \\r , \\'Then _don\\'t_ think of it, ma\\'am,\\' rejoined Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'I can\\'t help it,\\' whimpered the lady.\\r , \\r , \\'Then take something, ma\\'am,\\' said Mr. Bumble soothingly.  \\'A little of\\r , the wine?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not for the world!\\' replied Mrs. Corney.  \\'I couldn\\'t,--oh!  The top\\r , shelf in the right-hand corner--oh!\\'  Uttering these words, the good\\r , lady pointed, distractedly, to the cupboard, and underwent a convulsion\\r , from internal spasms.  Mr. Bumble rushed to the closet; and, snatching\\r , a pint green-glass bottle from the shelf thus incoherently indicated,\\r , filled a tea-cup with its contents, and held it to the lady\\'s lips.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'m better now,\\' said Mrs. Corney, falling back, after drinking half\\r , of it.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble raised his eyes piously to the ceiling in thankfulness; and,\\r , bringing them down again to the brim of the cup, lifted it to his nose.\\r , \\r , \\'Peppermint,\\' exclaimed Mrs. Corney, in a faint voice, smiling gently\\r , on the beadle as she spoke.  \\'Try it!  There\\'s a little--a little\\r , something else in it.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble tasted the medicine with a doubtful look; smacked his lips;\\r , took another taste; and put the cup down empty.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s very comforting,\\' said Mrs. Corney.\\r , \\r , \\'Very much so indeed, ma\\'am,\\' said the beadle.  As he spoke, he drew a\\r , chair beside the matron, and tenderly inquired what had happened to\\r , distress her.\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing,\\' replied Mrs. Corney.  \\'I am a foolish, excitable, weak\\r , creetur.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not weak, ma\\'am,\\' retorted Mr. Bumble, drawing his chair a little\\r , closer.  \\'Are you a weak creetur, Mrs. Corney?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'We are all weak creeturs,\\' said Mrs. Corney, laying down a general\\r , principle.\\r , \\r , \\'So we are,\\' said the beadle.\\r , \\r , Nothing was said on either side, for a minute or two afterwards. By the\\r , expiration of that time, Mr. Bumble had illustrated the position by\\r , removing his left arm from the back of Mrs. Corney\\'s chair, where it\\r , had previously rested, to Mrs. Corney\\'s apron-string, round which it\\r , gradually became entwined.\\r , \\r , \\'We are all weak creeturs,\\' said Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , Mrs. Corney sighed.\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t sigh, Mrs. Corney,\\' said Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'I can\\'t help it,\\' said Mrs. Corney.  And she sighed again.\\r , \\r , \\'This is a very comfortable room, ma\\'am,\\' said Mr. Bumble looking\\r , round.  \\'Another room, and this, ma\\'am, would be a complete thing.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It would be too much for one,\\' murmured the lady.\\r , \\r , \\'But not for two, ma\\'am,\\' rejoined Mr. Bumble, in soft accents. \\'Eh,\\r , Mrs. Corney?\\'\\r , \\r , Mrs. Corney drooped her head, when the beadle said this; the beadle\\r , drooped his, to get a view of Mrs. Corney\\'s face.  Mrs. Corney, with\\r , great propriety, turned her head away, and released her hand to get at\\r , her pocket-handkerchief; but insensibly replaced it in that of Mr.\\r , Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'The board allows you coals, don\\'t they, Mrs. Corney?\\' inquired the\\r , beadle, affectionately pressing her hand.\\r , \\r , \\'And candles,\\' replied Mrs. Corney, slightly returning the pressure.\\r , \\r , \\'Coals, candles, and house-rent free,\\' said Mr. Bumble.  \\'Oh, Mrs.\\r , Corney, what an Angel you are!\\'\\r , \\r , The lady was not proof against this burst of feeling.  She sank into\\r , Mr. Bumble\\'s arms; and that gentleman in his agitation, imprinted a\\r , passionate kiss upon her chaste nose.\\r , \\r , \\'Such porochial perfection!\\' exclaimed Mr. Bumble, rapturously. \\'You\\r , know that Mr. Slout is worse to-night, my fascinator?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' replied Mrs. Corney, bashfully.\\r , \\r , \\'He can\\'t live a week, the doctor says,\\' pursued Mr. Bumble. \\'He is the\\r , master of this establishment; his death will cause a wacancy; that\\r , wacancy must be filled up.  Oh, Mrs. Corney, what a prospect this\\r , opens!  What a opportunity for a jining of hearts and housekeepings!\\'\\r , \\r , Mrs. Corney sobbed.\\r , \\r , \\'The little word?\\' said Mr. Bumble, bending over the bashful beauty.\\r , \\'The one little, little, little word, my blessed Corney?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ye--ye--yes!\\' sighed out the matron.\\r , \\r , \\'One more,\\' pursued the beadle; \\'compose your darling feelings for only\\r , one more.  When is it to come off?\\'\\r , \\r , Mrs. Corney twice essayed to speak:  and twice failed.  At length\\r , summoning up courage, she threw her arms around Mr. Bumble\\'s neck, and\\r , said, it might be as soon as ever he pleased, and that he was \\'a\\r , irresistible duck.\\'\\r , \\r , Matters being thus amicably and satisfactorily arranged, the contract\\r , was solemnly ratified in another teacupful of the peppermint mixture;\\r , which was rendered the more necessary, by the flutter and agitation of\\r , the lady\\'s spirits.  While it was being disposed of, she acquainted Mr.\\r , Bumble with the old woman\\'s decease.\\r , \\r , \\'Very good,\\' said that gentleman, sipping his peppermint; \\'I\\'ll call at\\r , Sowerberry\\'s as I go home, and tell him to send to-morrow morning.  Was\\r , it that as frightened you, love?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It wasn\\'t anything particular, dear,\\' said the lady evasively.\\r , \\r , \\'It must have been something, love,\\' urged Mr. Bumble. \\'Won\\'t you tell\\r , your own B.?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not now,\\' rejoined the lady; \\'one of these days.  After we\\'re married,\\r , dear.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'After we\\'re married!\\' exclaimed Mr. Bumble.  \\'It wasn\\'t any impudence\\r , from any of them male paupers as--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, no, love!\\' interposed the lady, hastily.\\r , \\r , \\'If I thought it was,\\' continued Mr. Bumble; \\'if I thought as any one\\r , of \\'em had dared to lift his wulgar eyes to that lovely countenance--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'They wouldn\\'t have dared to do it, love,\\' responded the lady.\\r , \\r , \\'They had better not!\\' said Mr. Bumble, clenching his fist. \\'Let me see\\r , any man, porochial or extra-porochial, as would presume to do it; and I\\r , can tell him that he wouldn\\'t do it a second time!\\'\\r , \\r , Unembellished by any violence of gesticulation, this might have seemed\\r , no very high compliment to the lady\\'s charms; but, as Mr. Bumble\\r , accompanied the threat with many warlike gestures, she was much touched\\r , with this proof of his devotion, and protested, with great admiration,\\r , that he was indeed a dove.\\r , \\r , The dove then turned up his coat-collar, and put on his cocked hat;\\r , and, having exchanged a long and affectionate embrace with his future\\r , partner, once again braved the cold wind of the night: merely pausing,\\r , for a few minutes, in the male paupers\\' ward, to abuse them a little,\\r , with the view of satisfying himself that he could fill the office of\\r , workhouse-master with needful acerbity. Assured of his qualifications,\\r , Mr. Bumble left the building with a light heart, and bright visions of\\r , his future promotion:  which served to occupy his mind until he reached\\r , the shop of the undertaker.\\r , \\r , Now, Mr. and Mrs. Sowerberry having gone out to tea and supper: and\\r , Noah Claypole not being at any time disposed to take upon himself a\\r , greater amount of physical exertion than is necessary to a convenient\\r , performance of the two functions of eating and drinking, the shop was\\r , not closed, although it was past the usual hour of shutting-up.  Mr.\\r , Bumble tapped with his cane on the counter several times; but,\\r , attracting no attention, and beholding a light shining through the\\r , glass-window of the little parlour at the back of the shop, he made\\r , bold to peep in and see what was going forward; and when he saw what\\r , was going forward, he was not a little surprised.\\r , \\r , The cloth was laid for supper; the table was covered with bread and\\r , butter, plates and glasses; a porter-pot and a wine-bottle. At the\\r , upper end of the table, Mr. Noah Claypole lolled negligently in an\\r , easy-chair, with his legs thrown over one of the arms: an open\\r , clasp-knife in one hand, and a mass of buttered bread in the other.\\r , Close beside him stood Charlotte, opening oysters from a barrel: which\\r , Mr. Claypole condescended to swallow, with remarkable avidity.  A more\\r , than ordinary redness in the region of the young gentleman\\'s nose, and\\r , a kind of fixed wink in his right eye, denoted that he was in a slight\\r , degree intoxicated; these symptoms were confirmed by the intense relish\\r , with which he took his oysters, for which nothing but a strong\\r , appreciation of their cooling properties, in cases of internal fever,\\r , could have sufficiently accounted.\\r , \\r , \\'Here\\'s a delicious fat one, Noah, dear!\\' said Charlotte; \\'try him, do;\\r , only this one.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What a delicious thing is a oyster!\\' remarked Mr. Claypole, after he\\r , had swallowed it.  \\'What a pity it is, a number of \\'em should ever make\\r , you feel uncomfortable; isn\\'t it, Charlotte?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s quite a cruelty,\\' said Charlotte.\\r , \\r , \\'So it is,\\' acquiesced Mr. Claypole. \\'An\\'t yer fond of oysters?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not overmuch,\\' replied Charlotte.  \\'I like to see you eat \\'em, Noah\\r , dear, better than eating \\'em myself.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Lor!\\' said Noah, reflectively; \\'how queer!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Have another,\\' said Charlotte.  \\'Here\\'s one with such a beautiful,\\r , delicate beard!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I can\\'t manage any more,\\' said Noah.  \\'I\\'m very sorry.  Come here,\\r , Charlotte, and I\\'ll kiss yer.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What!\\' said Mr. Bumble, bursting into the room.  \\'Say that again, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , Charlotte uttered a scream, and hid her face in her apron.  Mr.\\r , Claypole, without making any further change in his position than\\r , suffering his legs to reach the ground, gazed at the beadle in drunken\\r , terror.\\r , \\r , \\'Say it again, you wile, owdacious fellow!\\' said Mr. Bumble. \\'How dare\\r , you mention such a thing, sir?  And how dare you encourage him, you\\r , insolent minx?  Kiss her!\\' exclaimed Mr. Bumble, in strong indignation.\\r , \\'Faugh!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I didn\\'t mean to do it!\\' said Noah, blubbering.  \\'She\\'s always\\r , a-kissing of me, whether I like it, or not.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, Noah,\\' cried Charlotte, reproachfully.\\r , \\r , \\'Yer are; yer know yer are!\\' retorted Noah.  \\'She\\'s always a-doin\\' of\\r , it, Mr. Bumble, sir; she chucks me under the chin, please, sir; and\\r , makes all manner of love!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Silence!\\' cried Mr. Bumble, sternly.  \\'Take yourself downstairs,\\r , ma\\'am.  Noah, you shut up the shop; say another word till your master\\r , comes home, at your peril; and, when he does come home, tell him that\\r , Mr. Bumble said he was to send a old woman\\'s shell after breakfast\\r , to-morrow morning.  Do you hear sir?  Kissing!\\' cried Mr. Bumble,\\r , holding up his hands.  \\'The sin and wickedness of the lower orders in\\r , this porochial district is frightful!  If Parliament don\\'t take their\\r , abominable courses under consideration, this country\\'s ruined, and the\\r , character of the peasantry gone for ever!\\'  With these words, the\\r , beadle strode, with a lofty and gloomy air, from the undertaker\\'s\\r , premises.\\r , \\r , And now that we have accompanied him so far on his road home, and have\\r , made all necessary preparations for the old woman\\'s funeral, let us set\\r , on foot a few inquires after young Oliver Twist, and ascertain whether\\r , he be still lying in the ditch where Toby Crackit left him.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXVIII\\r , \\r , LOOKS AFTER OLIVER, AND PROCEEDS WITH HIS ADVENTURES\\r , \\r , \\'Wolves tear your throats!\\' muttered Sikes, grinding his teeth. \\'I wish\\r , I was among some of you; you\\'d howl the hoarser for it.\\'\\r , \\r , As Sikes growled forth this imprecation, with the most desperate\\r , ferocity that his desperate nature was capable of, he rested the body\\r , of the wounded boy across his bended knee; and turned his head, for an\\r , instant, to look back at his pursuers.\\r , \\r , There was little to be made out, in the mist and darkness; but the loud\\r , shouting of men vibrated through the air, and the barking of the\\r , neighbouring dogs, roused by the sound of the alarm bell, resounded in\\r , every direction.\\r , \\r , \\'Stop, you white-livered hound!\\' cried the robber, shouting after Toby\\r , Crackit, who, making the best use of his long legs, was already ahead.\\r , \\'Stop!\\'\\r , \\r , The repetition of the word, brought Toby to a dead stand-still. For he\\r , was not quite satisfied that he was beyond the range of pistol-shot;\\r , and Sikes was in no mood to be played with.\\r , \\r , \\'Bear a hand with the boy,\\' cried Sikes, beckoning furiously to his\\r , confederate.  \\'Come back!\\'\\r , \\r , Toby made a show of returning; but ventured, in a low voice, broken for\\r , want of breath, to intimate considerable reluctance as he came slowly\\r , along.\\r , \\r , \\'Quicker!\\' cried Sikes, laying the boy in a dry ditch at his feet, and\\r , drawing a pistol from his pocket.  \\'Don\\'t play booty with me.\\'\\r , \\r , At this moment the noise grew louder.  Sikes, again looking round,\\r , could discern that the men who had given chase were already climbing\\r , the gate of the field in which he stood; and that a couple of dogs were\\r , some paces in advance of them.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s all up, Bill!\\' cried Toby; \\'drop the kid, and show \\'em your\\r , heels.\\'  With this parting advice, Mr. Crackit, preferring the chance\\r , of being shot by his friend, to the certainty of being taken by his\\r , enemies, fairly turned tail, and darted off at full speed.  Sikes\\r , clenched his teeth; took one look around; threw over the prostrate form\\r , of Oliver, the cape in which he had been hurriedly muffled; ran along\\r , the front of the hedge, as if to distract the attention of those\\r , behind, from the spot where the boy lay; paused, for a second, before\\r , another hedge which met it at right angles; and whirling his pistol\\r , high into the air, cleared it at a bound, and was gone.\\r , \\r , \\'Ho, ho, there!\\' cried a tremulous voice in the rear. \\'Pincher!\\r , Neptune!  Come here, come here!\\'\\r , \\r , The dogs, who, in common with their masters, seemed to have no\\r , particular relish for the sport in which they were engaged, readily\\r , answered to the command.  Three men, who had by this time advanced some\\r , distance into the field, stopped to take counsel together.\\r , \\r , \\'My advice, or, leastways, I should say, my _orders_, is,\\' said the\\r , fattest man of the party, \\'that we \\'mediately go home again.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I am agreeable to anything which is agreeable to Mr. Giles,\\' said a\\r , shorter man; who was by no means of a slim figure, and who was very\\r , pale in the face, and very polite: as frightened men frequently are.\\r , \\r , \\'I shouldn\\'t wish to appear ill-mannered, gentlemen,\\' said the third,\\r , who had called the dogs back, \\'Mr. Giles ought to know.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Certainly,\\' replied the shorter man; \\'and whatever Mr. Giles says, it\\r , isn\\'t our place to contradict him.  No, no, I know my sitiwation!\\r , Thank my stars, I know my sitiwation.\\'  To tell the truth, the little\\r , man _did_ seem to know his situation, and to know perfectly well that\\r , it was by no means a desirable one; for his teeth chattered in his head\\r , as he spoke.\\r , \\r , \\'You are afraid, Brittles,\\' said Mr. Giles.\\r , \\r , \\'I an\\'t,\\' said Brittles.\\r , \\r , \\'You are,\\' said Giles.\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'re a falsehood, Mr. Giles,\\' said Brittles.\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'re a lie, Brittles,\\' said Mr. Giles.\\r , \\r , Now, these four retorts arose from Mr. Giles\\'s taunt; and Mr. Giles\\'s\\r , taunt had arisen from his indignation at having the responsibility of\\r , going home again, imposed upon himself under cover of a compliment.\\r , The third man brought the dispute to a close, most philosophically.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ll tell you what it is, gentlemen,\\' said he, \\'we\\'re all afraid.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Speak for yourself, sir,\\' said Mr. Giles, who was the palest of the\\r , party.\\r , \\r , \\'So I do,\\' replied the man.  \\'It\\'s natural and proper to be afraid,\\r , under such circumstances.  I am.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'So am I,\\' said Brittles; \\'only there\\'s no call to tell a man he is, so\\r , bounceably.\\'\\r , \\r , These frank admissions softened Mr. Giles, who at once owned that _he_\\r , was afraid; upon which, they all three faced about, and ran back again\\r , with the completest unanimity, until Mr. Giles (who had the shortest\\r , wind of the party, as was encumbered with a pitchfork) most handsomely\\r , insisted on stopping, to make an apology for his hastiness of speech.\\r , \\r , \\'But it\\'s wonderful,\\' said Mr. Giles, when he had explained, \\'what a\\r , man will do, when his blood is up.  I should have committed murder--I\\r , know I should--if we\\'d caught one of them rascals.\\'\\r , \\r , As the other two were impressed with a similar presentiment; and as\\r , their blood, like his, had all gone down again; some speculation ensued\\r , upon the cause of this sudden change in their temperament.\\r , \\r , \\'I know what it was,\\' said Mr. Giles; \\'it was the gate.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I shouldn\\'t wonder if it was,\\' exclaimed Brittles, catching at the\\r , idea.\\r , \\r , \\'You may depend upon it,\\' said Giles, \\'that that gate stopped the flow\\r , of the excitement.  I felt all mine suddenly going away, as I was\\r , climbing over it.\\'\\r , \\r , By a remarkable coincidence, the other two had been visited with the\\r , same unpleasant sensation at that precise moment.  It was quite\\r , obvious, therefore, that it was the gate; especially as there was no\\r , doubt regarding the time at which the change had taken place, because\\r , all three remembered that they had come in sight of the robbers at the\\r , instant of its occurance.\\r , \\r , This dialogue was held between the two men who had surprised the\\r , burglars, and a travelling tinker who had been sleeping in an outhouse,\\r , and who had been roused, together with his two mongrel curs, to join in\\r , the pursuit.  Mr. Giles acted in the double capacity of butler and\\r , steward to the old lady of the mansion; Brittles was a lad of all-work:\\r , who, having entered her service a mere child, was treated as a\\r , promising young boy still, though he was something past thirty.\\r , \\r , Encouraging each other with such converse as this; but, keeping very\\r , close together, notwithstanding, and looking apprehensively round,\\r , whenever a fresh gust rattled through the boughs; the three men hurried\\r , back to a tree, behind which they had left their lantern, lest its\\r , light should inform the thieves in what direction to fire.  Catching up\\r , the light, they made the best of their way home, at a good round trot;\\r , and long after their dusky forms had ceased to be discernible, the\\r , light might have been seen twinkling and dancing in the distance, like\\r , some exhalation of the damp and gloomy atmosphere through which it was\\r , swiftly borne.\\r , \\r , The air grew colder, as day came slowly on; and the mist rolled along\\r , the ground like a dense cloud of smoke.  The grass was wet; the\\r , pathways, and low places, were all mire and water; the damp breath of\\r , an unwholesome wind went languidly by, with a hollow moaning.  Still,\\r , Oliver lay motionless and insensible on the spot where Sikes had left\\r , him.\\r , \\r , Morning drew on apace.  The air become more sharp and piercing, as its\\r , first dull hue--the death of night, rather than the birth of\\r , day--glimmered faintly in the sky.  The objects which had looked dim\\r , and terrible in the darkness, grew more and more defined, and gradually\\r , resolved into their familiar shapes.  The rain came down, thick and\\r , fast, and pattered noisily among the leafless bushes.  But, Oliver felt\\r , it not, as it beat against him; for he still lay stretched, helpless\\r , and unconscious, on his bed of clay.\\r , \\r , At length, a low cry of pain broke the stillness that prevailed; and\\r , uttering it, the boy awoke.  His left arm, rudely bandaged in a shawl,\\r , hung heavy and useless at his side; the bandage was saturated with\\r , blood.  He was so weak, that he could scarcely raise himself into a\\r , sitting posture; when he had done so, he looked feebly round for help,\\r , and groaned with pain.  Trembling in every joint, from cold and\\r , exhaustion, he made an effort to stand upright; but, shuddering from\\r , head to foot, fell prostrate on the ground.\\r , \\r , After a short return of the stupor in which he had been so long\\r , plunged, Oliver:  urged by a creeping sickness at his heart, which\\r , seemed to warn him that if he lay there, he must surely die:  got upon\\r , his feet, and essayed to walk. His head was dizzy, and he staggered to\\r , and fro like a drunken man.  But he kept up, nevertheless, and, with\\r , his head drooping languidly on his breast, went stumbling onward, he\\r , knew not whither.\\r , \\r , And now, hosts of bewildering and confused ideas came crowding on his\\r , mind.  He seemed to be still walking between Sikes and Crackit, who\\r , were angrily disputing--for the very words they said, sounded in his\\r , ears; and when he caught his own attention, as it were, by making some\\r , violent effort to save himself from falling, he found that he was\\r , talking to them. Then, he was alone with Sikes, plodding on as on the\\r , previous day; and as shadowy people passed them, he felt the robber\\'s\\r , grasp upon his wrist. Suddenly, he started back at the report of\\r , firearms; there rose into the air, loud cries and shouts; lights\\r , gleamed before his eyes; all was noise and tumult, as some unseen hand\\r , bore him hurriedly away.  Through all these rapid visions, there ran an\\r , undefined, uneasy consciousness of pain, which wearied and tormented\\r , him incessantly.\\r , \\r , Thus he staggered on, creeping, almost mechanically, between the bars\\r , of gates, or through hedge-gaps as they came in his way, until he\\r , reached a road.  Here the rain began to fall so heavily, that it roused\\r , him.\\r , \\r , He looked about, and saw that at no great distance there was a house,\\r , which perhaps he could reach.  Pitying his condition, they might have\\r , compassion on him; and if they did not, it would be better, he thought,\\r , to die near human beings, than in the lonely open fields.  He summoned\\r , up all his strength for one last trial, and bent his faltering steps\\r , towards it.\\r , \\r , As he drew nearer to this house, a feeling come over him that he had\\r , seen it before.  He remembered nothing of its details; but the shape\\r , and aspect of the building seemed familiar to him.\\r , \\r , That garden wall!  On the grass inside, he had fallen on his knees last\\r , night, and prayed the two men\\'s mercy.  It was the very house they had\\r , attempted to rob.\\r , \\r , Oliver felt such fear come over him when he recognised the place, that,\\r , for the instant, he forgot the agony of his wound, and thought only of\\r , flight.  Flight!  He could scarcely stand:  and if he were in full\\r , possession of all the best powers of his slight and youthful frame,\\r , whither could he fly?  He pushed against the garden-gate; it was\\r , unlocked, and swung open on its hinges.  He tottered across the lawn;\\r , climbed the steps; knocked faintly at the door; and, his whole strength\\r , failing him, sunk down against one of the pillars of the little portico.\\r , \\r , It happened that about this time, Mr. Giles, Brittles, and the tinker,\\r , were recruiting themselves, after the fatigues and terrors of the\\r , night, with tea and sundries, in the kitchen.  Not that it was Mr.\\r , Giles\\'s habit to admit to too great familiarity the humbler servants:\\r , towards whom it was rather his wont to deport himself with a lofty\\r , affability, which, while it gratified, could not fail to remind them of\\r , his superior position in society.  But, death, fires, and burglary,\\r , make all men equals; so Mr. Giles sat with his legs stretched out\\r , before the kitchen fender, leaning his left arm on the table, while,\\r , with his right, he illustrated a circumstantial and minute account of\\r , the robbery, to which his bearers (but especially the cook and\\r , housemaid, who were of the party) listened with breathless interest.\\r , \\r , \\'It was about half-past two,\\' said Mr. Giles, \\'or I wouldn\\'t swear that\\r , it mightn\\'t have been a little nearer three, when I woke up, and,\\r , turning round in my bed, as it might be so, (here Mr. Giles turned\\r , round in his chair, and pulled the corner of the table-cloth over him\\r , to imitate bed-clothes,) I fancied I heerd a noise.\\'\\r , \\r , At this point of the narrative the cook turned pale, and asked the\\r , housemaid to shut the door: who asked Brittles, who asked the tinker,\\r , who pretended not to hear.\\r , \\r , \\'--Heerd a noise,\\' continued Mr. Giles.  \\'I says, at first, \"This is\\r , illusion\"; and was composing myself off to sleep, when I heerd the\\r , noise again, distinct.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What sort of a noise?\\' asked the cook.\\r , \\r , \\'A kind of a busting noise,\\' replied Mr. Giles, looking round him.\\r , \\r , \\'More like the noise of powdering a iron bar on a nutmeg-grater,\\'\\r , suggested Brittles.\\r , \\r , \\'It was, when _you_ heerd it, sir,\\' rejoined Mr. Giles; \\'but, at this\\r , time, it had a busting sound.  I turned down the clothes\\'; continued\\r , Giles, rolling back the table-cloth, \\'sat up in bed; and listened.\\'\\r , \\r , The cook and housemaid simultaneously ejaculated \\'Lor!\\' and drew their\\r , chairs closer together.\\r , \\r , \\'I heerd it now, quite apparent,\\' resumed Mr. Giles. \\'\"Somebody,\" I\\r , says, \"is forcing of a door, or window; what\\'s to be done? I\\'ll call up\\r , that poor lad, Brittles, and save him from being murdered in his bed;\\r , or his throat,\" I says, \"may be cut from his right ear to his left,\\r , without his ever knowing it.\"\\'\\r , \\r , Here, all eyes were turned upon Brittles, who fixed his upon the\\r , speaker, and stared at him, with his mouth wide open, and his face\\r , expressive of the most unmitigated horror.\\r , \\r , \\'I tossed off the clothes,\\' said Giles, throwing away the table-cloth,\\r , and looking very hard at the cook and housemaid, \\'got softly out of\\r , bed; drew on a pair of--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ladies present, Mr. Giles,\\' murmured the tinker.\\r , \\r , \\'--Of _shoes_, sir,\\' said Giles, turning upon him, and laying great\\r , emphasis on the word; \\'seized the loaded pistol that always goes\\r , upstairs with the plate-basket; and walked on tiptoes to his room.\\r , \"Brittles,\" I says, when I had woke him, \"don\\'t be frightened!\"\\'\\r , \\r , \\'So you did,\\' observed Brittles, in a low voice.\\r , \\r , \\'\"We\\'re dead men, I think, Brittles,\" I says,\\' continued Giles; \\'\"but\\r , don\\'t be frightened.\"\\'\\r , \\r , \\'_Was_ he frightened?\\' asked the cook.\\r , \\r , \\'Not a bit of it,\\' replied Mr. Giles.  \\'He was as firm--ah! pretty near\\r , as firm as I was.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I should have died at once, I\\'m sure, if it had been me,\\' observed the\\r , housemaid.\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'re a woman,\\' retorted Brittles, plucking up a little.\\r , \\r , \\'Brittles is right,\\' said Mr. Giles, nodding his head, approvingly;\\r , \\'from a woman, nothing else was to be expected. We, being men, took a\\r , dark lantern that was standing on Brittle\\'s hob, and groped our way\\r , downstairs in the pitch dark,--as it might be so.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Giles had risen from his seat, and taken two steps with his eyes\\r , shut, to accompany his description with appropriate action, when he\\r , started violently, in common with the rest of the company, and hurried\\r , back to his chair.  The cook and housemaid screamed.\\r , \\r , \\'It was a knock,\\' said Mr. Giles, assuming perfect serenity. \\'Open the\\r , door, somebody.\\'\\r , \\r , Nobody moved.\\r , \\r , \\'It seems a strange sort of a thing, a knock coming at such a time in\\r , the morning,\\' said Mr. Giles, surveying the pale faces which surrounded\\r , him, and looking very blank himself; \\'but the door must be opened.  Do\\r , you hear, somebody?\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Giles, as he spoke, looked at Brittles; but that young man, being\\r , naturally modest, probably considered himself nobody, and so held that\\r , the inquiry could not have any application to him; at all events, he\\r , tendered no reply. Mr. Giles directed an appealing glance at the\\r , tinker; but he had suddenly fallen asleep.  The women were out of the\\r , question.\\r , \\r , \\'If Brittles would rather open the door, in the presence of witnesses,\\'\\r , said Mr. Giles, after a short silence, \\'I am ready to make one.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'So am I,\\' said the tinker, waking up, as suddenly as he had fallen\\r , asleep.\\r , \\r , Brittles capitulated on these terms; and the party being somewhat\\r , re-assured by the discovery (made on throwing open the shutters) that\\r , it was now broad day, took their way upstairs; with the dogs in front.\\r , The two women, who were afraid to stay below, brought up the rear.  By\\r , the advice of Mr. Giles, they all talked very loud, to warn any\\r , evil-disposed person outside, that they were strong in numbers; and by\\r , a master-stoke of policy, originating in the brain of the same\\r , ingenious gentleman, the dogs\\' tails were well pinched, in the hall, to\\r , make them bark savagely.\\r , \\r , These precautions having been taken, Mr. Giles held on fast by the\\r , tinker\\'s arm (to prevent his running away, as he pleasantly said), and\\r , gave the word of command to open the door.  Brittles obeyed; the group,\\r , peeping timorously over each other\\'s shoulders, beheld no more\\r , formidable object than poor little Oliver Twist, speechless and\\r , exhausted, who raised his heavy eyes, and mutely solicited their\\r , compassion.\\r , \\r , \\'A boy!\\' exclaimed Mr. Giles, valiantly, pushing the tinker into the\\r , background.  \\'What\\'s the matter with the--eh?--Why--Brittles--look\\r , here--don\\'t you know?\\'\\r , \\r , Brittles, who had got behind the door to open it, no sooner saw Oliver,\\r , than he uttered a loud cry.  Mr. Giles, seizing the boy by one leg and\\r , one arm (fortunately not the broken limb) lugged him straight into the\\r , hall, and deposited him at full length on the floor thereof.\\r , \\r , \\'Here he is!\\' bawled Giles, calling in a state of great excitement, up\\r , the staircase; \\'here\\'s one of the thieves, ma\\'am! Here\\'s a thief, miss!\\r , Wounded, miss!  I shot him, miss; and Brittles held the light.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'--In a lantern, miss,\\' cried Brittles, applying one hand to the side\\r , of his mouth, so that his voice might travel the better.\\r , \\r , The two women-servants ran upstairs to carry the intelligence that Mr.\\r , Giles had captured a robber; and the tinker busied himself in\\r , endeavouring to restore Oliver, lest he should die before he could be\\r , hanged.  In the midst of all this noise and commotion, there was heard\\r , a sweet female voice, which quelled it in an instant.\\r , \\r , \\'Giles!\\' whispered the voice from the stair-head.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'m here, miss,\\' replied Mr. Giles.  \\'Don\\'t be frightened, miss; I\\r , ain\\'t much injured.  He didn\\'t make a very desperate resistance, miss!\\r , I was soon too many for him.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hush!\\' replied the young lady; \\'you frighten my aunt as much as the\\r , thieves did.  Is the poor creature much hurt?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Wounded desperate, miss,\\' replied Giles, with indescribable\\r , complacency.\\r , \\r , \\'He looks as if he was a-going, miss,\\' bawled Brittles, in the same\\r , manner as before.  \\'Wouldn\\'t you like to come and look at him, miss, in\\r , case he should?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hush, pray; there\\'s a good man!\\' rejoined the lady.  \\'Wait quietly\\r , only one instant, while I speak to aunt.\\'\\r , \\r , With a footstep as soft and gentle as the voice, the speaker tripped\\r , away.  She soon returned, with the direction that the wounded person\\r , was to be carried, carefully, upstairs to Mr. Giles\\'s room; and that\\r , Brittles was to saddle the pony and betake himself instantly to\\r , Chertsey:  from which place, he was to despatch, with all speed, a\\r , constable and doctor.\\r , \\r , \\'But won\\'t you take one look at him, first, miss?\\' asked Mr. Giles,\\r , with as much pride as if Oliver were some bird of rare plumage, that he\\r , had skilfully brought down.  \\'Not one little peep, miss?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not now, for the world,\\' replied the young lady.  \\'Poor fellow! Oh!\\r , treat him kindly, Giles for my sake!\\'\\r , \\r , The old servant looked up at the speaker, as she turned away, with a\\r , glance as proud and admiring as if she had been his own child.  Then,\\r , bending over Oliver, he helped to carry him upstairs, with the care and\\r , solicitude of a woman.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXIX\\r , \\r , HAS AN INTRODUCTORY ACCOUNT OF THE INMATES OF THE HOUSE, TO WHICH\\r , OLIVER RESORTED\\r , \\r , In a handsome room:  though its furniture had rather the air of\\r , old-fashioned comfort, than of modern elegance:  there sat two ladies\\r , at a well-spread breakfast-table.  Mr. Giles, dressed with scrupulous\\r , care in a full suit of black, was in attendance upon them.  He had\\r , taken his station some half-way between the side-board and the\\r , breakfast-table; and, with his body drawn up to its full height, his\\r , head thrown back, and inclined the merest trifle on one side, his left\\r , leg advanced, and his right hand thrust into his waist-coat, while his\\r , left hung down by his side, grasping a waiter, looked like one who\\r , laboured under a very agreeable sense of his own merits and importance.\\r , \\r , Of the two ladies, one was well advanced in years; but the high-backed\\r , oaken chair in which she sat, was not more upright than she.  Dressed\\r , with the utmost nicety and precision, in a quaint mixture of by-gone\\r , costume, with some slight concessions to the prevailing taste, which\\r , rather served to point the old style pleasantly than to impair its\\r , effect, she sat, in a stately manner, with her hands folded on the\\r , table before her.  Her eyes (and age had dimmed but little of their\\r , brightness) were attentively upon her young companion.\\r , \\r , The younger lady was in the lovely bloom and spring-time of womanhood;\\r , at that age, when, if ever angels be for God\\'s good purposes enthroned\\r , in mortal forms, they may be, without impiety, supposed to abide in\\r , such as hers.\\r , \\r , She was not past seventeen.  Cast in so slight and exquisite a mould;\\r , so mild and gentle; so pure and beautiful; that earth seemed not her\\r , element, nor its rough creatures her fit companions.  The very\\r , intelligence that shone in her deep blue eye, and was stamped upon her\\r , noble head, seemed scarcely of her age, or of the world; and yet the\\r , changing expression of sweetness and good humour, the thousand lights\\r , that played about the face, and left no shadow there; above all, the\\r , smile, the cheerful, happy smile, were made for Home, and fireside\\r , peace and happiness.\\r , \\r , She was busily engaged in the little offices of the table. Chancing to\\r , raise her eyes as the elder lady was regarding her, she playfully put\\r , back her hair, which was simply braided on her forehead; and threw into\\r , her beaming look, such an expression of affection and artless\\r , loveliness, that blessed spirits might have smiled to look upon her.\\r , \\r , \\'And Brittles has been gone upwards of an hour, has he?\\' asked the old\\r , lady, after a pause.\\r , \\r , \\'An hour and twelve minutes, ma\\'am,\\' replied Mr. Giles, referring to a\\r , silver watch, which he drew forth by a black ribbon.\\r , \\r , \\'He is always slow,\\' remarked the old lady.\\r , \\r , \\'Brittles always was a slow boy, ma\\'am,\\' replied the attendant. And\\r , seeing, by the bye, that Brittles had been a slow boy for upwards of\\r , thirty years, there appeared no great probability of his ever being a\\r , fast one.\\r , \\r , \\'He gets worse instead of better, I think,\\' said the elder lady.\\r , \\r , \\'It is very inexcusable in him if he stops to play with any other\\r , boys,\\' said the young lady, smiling.\\r , \\r , Mr. Giles was apparently considering the propriety of indulging in a\\r , respectful smile himself, when a gig drove up to the garden-gate: out\\r , of which there jumped a fat gentleman, who ran straight up to the door:\\r , and who, getting quickly into the house by some mysterious process,\\r , burst into the room, and nearly overturned Mr. Giles and the\\r , breakfast-table together.\\r , \\r , \\'I never heard of such a thing!\\' exclaimed the fat gentleman. \\'My dear\\r , Mrs. Maylie--bless my soul--in the silence of the night, too--I _never_\\r , heard of such a thing!\\'\\r , \\r , With these expressions of condolence, the fat gentleman shook hands\\r , with both ladies, and drawing up a chair, inquired how they found\\r , themselves.\\r , \\r , \\'You ought to be dead; positively dead with the fright,\\' said the fat\\r , gentleman.  \\'Why didn\\'t you send?  Bless me, my man should have come in\\r , a minute; and so would I; and my assistant would have been delighted;\\r , or anybody, I\\'m sure, under such circumstances.  Dear, dear!  So\\r , unexpected!  In the silence of the night, too!\\'\\r , \\r , The doctor seemed expecially troubled by the fact of the robbery having\\r , been unexpected, and attempted in the night-time; as if it were the\\r , established custom of gentlemen in the housebreaking way to transact\\r , business at noon, and to make an appointment, by post, a day or two\\r , previous.\\r , \\r , \\'And you, Miss Rose,\\' said the doctor, turning to the young lady, \\'I--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh! very much so, indeed,\\' said Rose, interrupting him; \\'but there is\\r , a poor creature upstairs, whom aunt wishes you to see.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah! to be sure,\\' replied the doctor, \\'so there is.  That was your\\r , handiwork, Giles, I understand.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Giles, who had been feverishly putting the tea-cups to rights,\\r , blushed very red, and said that he had had that honour.\\r , \\r , \\'Honour, eh?\\' said the doctor; \\'well, I don\\'t know; perhaps it\\'s as\\r , honourable to hit a thief in a back kitchen, as to hit your man at\\r , twelve paces.  Fancy that he fired in the air, and you\\'ve fought a\\r , duel, Giles.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Giles, who thought this light treatment of the matter an unjust\\r , attempt at diminishing his glory, answered respectfully, that it was\\r , not for the like of him to judge about that; but he rather thought it\\r , was no joke to the opposite party.\\r , \\r , \\'Gad, that\\'s true!\\' said the doctor.  \\'Where is he?  Show me the way.\\r , I\\'ll look in again, as I come down, Mrs. Maylie.  That\\'s the little\\r , window that he got in at, eh?  Well, I couldn\\'t have believed it!\\'\\r , \\r , Talking all the way, he followed Mr. Giles upstairs; and while he is\\r , going upstairs, the reader may be informed, that Mr. Losberne, a\\r , surgeon in the neighbourhood, known through a circuit of ten miles\\r , round as \\'the doctor,\\' had grown fat, more from good-humour than from\\r , good living:  and was as kind and hearty, and withal as eccentric an\\r , old bachelor, as will be found in five times that space, by any\\r , explorer alive.\\r , \\r , The doctor was absent, much longer than either he or the ladies had\\r , anticipated.  A large flat box was fetched out of the gig; and a\\r , bedroom bell was rung very often; and the servants ran up and down\\r , stairs perpetually; from which tokens it was justly concluded that\\r , something important was going on above.  At length he returned; and in\\r , reply to an anxious inquiry after his patient; looked very mysterious,\\r , and closed the door, carefully.\\r , \\r , \\'This is a very extraordinary thing, Mrs. Maylie,\\' said the doctor,\\r , standing with his back to the door, as if to keep it shut.\\r , \\r , \\'He is not in danger, I hope?\\' said the old lady.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, that would _not_ be an extraordinary thing, under the\\r , circumstances,\\' replied the doctor; \\'though I don\\'t think he is. Have\\r , you seen the thief?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' rejoined the old lady.\\r , \\r , \\'Nor heard anything about him?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I beg your pardon, ma\\'am, interposed Mr. Giles; \\'but I was going to\\r , tell you about him when Doctor Losberne came in.\\'\\r , \\r , The fact was, that Mr. Giles had not, at first, been able to bring his\\r , mind to the avowal, that he had only shot a boy.  Such commendations\\r , had been bestowed upon his bravery, that he could not, for the life of\\r , him, help postponing the explanation for a few delicious minutes;\\r , during which he had flourished, in the very zenith of a brief\\r , reputation for undaunted courage.\\r , \\r , \\'Rose wished to see the man,\\' said Mrs. Maylie, \\'but I wouldn\\'t hear of\\r , it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Humph!\\' rejoined the doctor.  \\'There is nothing very alarming in his\\r , appearance.  Have you any objection to see him in my presence?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If it be necessary,\\' replied the old lady, \\'certainly not.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then I think it is necessary,\\' said the doctor; \\'at all events, I am\\r , quite sure that you would deeply regret not having done so, if you\\r , postponed it.  He is perfectly quiet and comfortable now. Allow\\r , me--Miss Rose, will you permit me?  Not the slightest fear, I pledge\\r , you my honour!\\'\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXX\\r , \\r , RELATES WHAT OLIVER\\'S NEW VISITORS THOUGHT OF HIM\\r , \\r , With many loquacious assurances that they would be agreeably surprised\\r , in the aspect of the criminal, the doctor drew the young lady\\'s arm\\r , through one of his; and offering his disengaged hand to Mrs. Maylie,\\r , led them, with much ceremony and stateliness, upstairs.\\r , \\r , \\'Now,\\' said the doctor, in a whisper, as he softly turned the handle of\\r , a bedroom-door, \\'let us hear what you think of him.  He has not been\\r , shaved very recently, but he don\\'t look at all ferocious\\r , notwithstanding.  Stop, though!  Let me first see that he is in\\r , visiting order.\\'\\r , \\r , Stepping before them, he looked into the room.  Motioning them to\\r , advance, he closed the door when they had entered; and gently drew back\\r , the curtains of the bed.  Upon it, in lieu of the dogged, black-visaged\\r , ruffian they had expected to behold, there lay a mere child:  worn with\\r , pain and exhaustion, and sunk into a deep sleep.  His wounded arm,\\r , bound and splintered up, was crossed upon his breast; his head reclined\\r , upon the other arm, which was half hidden by his long hair, as it\\r , streamed over the pillow.\\r , \\r , The honest gentleman held the curtain in his hand, and looked on, for a\\r , minute or so, in silence.  Whilst he was watching the patient thus, the\\r , younger lady glided softly past, and seating herself in a chair by the\\r , bedside, gathered Oliver\\'s hair from his face.  As she stooped over\\r , him, her tears fell upon his forehead.\\r , \\r , The boy stirred, and smiled in his sleep, as though these marks of pity\\r , and compassion had awakened some pleasant dream of a love and affection\\r , he had never known.  Thus, a strain of gentle music, or the rippling of\\r , water in a silent place, or the odour of a flower, or the mention of a\\r , familiar word, will sometimes call up sudden dim remembrances of scenes\\r , that never were, in this life; which vanish like a breath; which some\\r , brief memory of a happier existence, long gone by, would seem to have\\r , awakened; which no voluntary exertion of the mind can ever recall.\\r , \\r , \\'What can this mean?\\' exclaimed the elder lady.  \\'This poor child can\\r , never have been the pupil of robbers!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Vice,\\' said the surgeon, replacing the curtain, \\'takes up her abode in\\r , many temples; and who can say that a fair outside shell not enshrine\\r , her?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'But at so early an age!\\' urged Rose.\\r , \\r , \\'My dear young lady,\\' rejoined the surgeon, mournfully shaking his\\r , head; \\'crime, like death, is not confined to the old and withered\\r , alone.  The youngest and fairest are too often its chosen victims.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'But, can you--oh! can you really believe that this delicate boy has\\r , been the voluntary associate of the worst outcasts of society?\\' said\\r , Rose.\\r , \\r , The surgeon shook his head, in a manner which intimated that he feared\\r , it was very possible; and observing that they might disturb the\\r , patient, led the way into an adjoining apartment.\\r , \\r , \\'But even if he has been wicked,\\' pursued Rose, \\'think how young he is;\\r , think that he may never have known a mother\\'s love, or the comfort of a\\r , home; that ill-usage and blows, or the want of bread, may have driven\\r , him to herd with men who have forced him to guilt.  Aunt, dear aunt,\\r , for mercy\\'s sake, think of this, before you let them drag this sick\\r , child to a prison, which in any case must be the grave of all his\\r , chances of amendment.  Oh! as you love me, and know that I have never\\r , felt the want of parents in your goodness and affection, but that I\\r , might have done so, and might have been equally helpless and\\r , unprotected with this poor child, have pity upon him before it is too\\r , late!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'My dear love,\\' said the elder lady, as she folded the weeping girl to\\r , her bosom, \\'do you think I would harm a hair of his head?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, no!\\' replied Rose, eagerly.\\r , \\r , \\'No, surely,\\' said the old lady; \\'my days are drawing to their close:\\r , and may mercy be shown to me as I show it to others! What can I do to\\r , save him, sir?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Let me think, ma\\'am,\\' said the doctor; \\'let me think.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Losberne thrust his hands into his pockets, and took several turns\\r , up and down the room; often stopping, and balancing himself on his\\r , toes, and frowning frightfully.  After various exclamations of \\'I\\'ve\\r , got it now\\' and \\'no, I haven\\'t,\\' and as many renewals of the walking\\r , and frowning, he at length made a dead halt, and spoke as follows:\\r , \\r , \\'I think if you give me a full and unlimited commission to bully Giles,\\r , and that little boy, Brittles, I can manage it.  Giles is a faithful\\r , fellow and an old servant, I know; but you can make it up to him in a\\r , thousand ways, and reward him for being such a good shot besides.  You\\r , don\\'t object to that?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Unless there is some other way of preserving the child,\\' replied Mrs.\\r , Maylie.\\r , \\r , \\'There is no other,\\' said the doctor.  \\'No other, take my word for it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then my aunt invests you with full power,\\' said Rose, smiling through\\r , her tears; \\'but pray don\\'t be harder upon the poor fellows than is\\r , indispensably necessary.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You seem to think,\\' retorted the doctor, \\'that everybody is disposed\\r , to be hard-hearted to-day, except yourself, Miss Rose. I only hope, for\\r , the sake of the rising male sex generally, that you may be found in as\\r , vulnerable and soft-hearted a mood by the first eligible young fellow\\r , who appeals to your compassion; and I wish I were a young fellow, that\\r , I might avail myself, on the spot, of such a favourable opportunity for\\r , doing so, as the present.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You are as great a boy as poor Brittles himself,\\' returned Rose,\\r , blushing.\\r , \\r , \\'Well,\\' said the doctor, laughing heartily, \\'that is no very difficult\\r , matter.  But to return to this boy.  The great point of our agreement\\r , is yet to come.  He will wake in an hour or so, I dare say; and\\r , although I have told that thick-headed constable-fellow downstairs that\\r , he musn\\'t be moved or spoken to, on peril of his life, I think we may\\r , converse with him without danger.  Now I make this stipulation--that I\\r , shall examine him in your presence, and that, if, from what he says, we\\r , judge, and I can show to the satisfaction of your cool reason, that he\\r , is a real and thorough bad one (which is more than possible), he shall\\r , be left to his fate, without any farther interference on my part, at\\r , all events.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh no, aunt!\\' entreated Rose.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh yes, aunt!\\' said the doctor.  \\'Is is a bargain?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He cannot be hardened in vice,\\' said Rose; \\'It is impossible.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Very good,\\' retorted the doctor; \\'then so much the more reason for\\r , acceding to my proposition.\\'\\r , \\r , Finally the treaty was entered into; and the parties thereunto sat down\\r , to wait, with some impatience, until Oliver should awake.\\r , \\r , The patience of the two ladies was destined to undergo a longer trial\\r , than Mr. Losberne had led them to expect; for hour after hour passed\\r , on, and still Oliver slumbered heavily.  It was evening, indeed, before\\r , the kind-hearted doctor brought them the intelligence, that he was at\\r , length sufficiently restored to be spoken to.  The boy was very ill, he\\r , said, and weak from the loss of blood; but his mind was so troubled\\r , with anxiety to disclose something, that he deemed it better to give\\r , him the opportunity, than to insist upon his remaining quiet until next\\r , morning: which he should otherwise have done.\\r , \\r , The conference was a long one.  Oliver told them all his simple\\r , history, and was often compelled to stop, by pain and want of strength.\\r , It was a solemn thing, to hear, in the darkened room, the feeble voice\\r , of the sick child recounting a weary catalogue of evils and calamities\\r , which hard men had brought upon him.  Oh! if when we oppress and grind\\r , our fellow-creatures, we bestowed but one thought on the dark evidences\\r , of human error, which, like dense and heavy clouds, are rising, slowly\\r , it is true, but not less surely, to Heaven, to pour their\\r , after-vengeance on our heads; if we heard but one instant, in\\r , imagination, the deep testimony of dead men\\'s voices, which no power\\r , can stifle, and no pride shut out; where would be the injury and\\r , injustice, the suffering, misery, cruelty, and wrong, that each day\\'s\\r , life brings with it!\\r , \\r , Oliver\\'s pillow was smoothed by gentle hands that night; and loveliness\\r , and virtue watched him as he slept.  He felt calm and happy, and could\\r , have died without a murmur.\\r , \\r , The momentous interview was no sooner concluded, and Oliver composed to\\r , rest again, than the doctor, after wiping his eyes, and condemning them\\r , for being weak all at once, betook himself downstairs to open upon Mr.\\r , Giles.  And finding nobody about the parlours, it occurred to him, that\\r , he could perhaps originate the proceedings with better effect in the\\r , kitchen; so into the kitchen he went.\\r , \\r , There were assembled, in that lower house of the domestic parliament,\\r , the women-servants, Mr. Brittles, Mr. Giles, the tinker (who had\\r , received a special invitation to regale himself for the remainder of\\r , the day, in consideration of his services), and the constable.  The\\r , latter gentleman had a large staff, a large head, large features, and\\r , large half-boots; and he looked as if he had been taking a\\r , proportionate allowance of ale--as indeed he had.\\r , \\r , The adventures of the previous night were still under discussion; for\\r , Mr. Giles was expatiating upon his presence of mind, when the doctor\\r , entered; Mr. Brittles, with a mug of ale in his hand, was corroborating\\r , everything, before his superior said it.\\r , \\r , \\'Sit still!\\' said the doctor, waving his hand.\\r , \\r , \\'Thank you, sir, said Mr. Giles.  \\'Misses wished some ale to be given\\r , out, sir; and as I felt no ways inclined for my own little room, sir,\\r , and was disposed for company, I am taking mine among \\'em here.\\'\\r , \\r , Brittles headed a low murmur, by which the ladies and gentlemen\\r , generally were understood to express the gratification they derived\\r , from Mr. Giles\\'s condescension.  Mr. Giles looked round with a\\r , patronising air, as much as to say that so long as they behaved\\r , properly, he would never desert them.\\r , \\r , \\'How is the patient to-night, sir?\\' asked Giles.\\r , \\r , \\'So-so\\'; returned the doctor.  \\'I am afraid you have got yourself into\\r , a scrape there, Mr. Giles.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I hope you don\\'t mean to say, sir,\\' said Mr. Giles, trembling, \\'that\\r , he\\'s going to die.  If I thought it, I should never be happy again.  I\\r , wouldn\\'t cut a boy off:  no, not even Brittles here; not for all the\\r , plate in the county, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s not the point,\\' said the doctor, mysteriously.  \\'Mr. Giles, are\\r , you a Protestant?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, sir, I hope so,\\' faltered Mr. Giles, who had turned very pale.\\r , \\r , \\'And what are _you_, boy?\\' said the doctor, turning sharply upon\\r , Brittles.\\r , \\r , \\'Lord bless me, sir!\\' replied Brittles, starting violently; \\'I\\'m the\\r , same as Mr. Giles, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then tell me this,\\' said the doctor, \\'both of you, both of you! Are\\r , you going to take upon yourselves to swear, that that boy upstairs is\\r , the boy that was put through the little window last night?  Out with\\r , it!  Come!  We are prepared for you!\\'\\r , \\r , The doctor, who was universally considered one of the best-tempered\\r , creatures on earth, made this demand in such a dreadful tone of anger,\\r , that Giles and Brittles, who were considerably muddled by ale and\\r , excitement, stared at each other in a state of stupefaction.\\r , \\r , \\'Pay attention to the reply, constable, will you?\\' said the doctor,\\r , shaking his forefinger with great solemnity of manner, and tapping the\\r , bridge of his nose with it, to bespeak the exercise of that worthy\\'s\\r , utmost acuteness. \\'Something may come of this before long.\\'\\r , \\r , The constable looked as wise as he could, and took up his staff of\\r , office: which had been reclining indolently in the chimney-corner.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s a simple question of identity, you will observe,\\' said the doctor.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s what it is, sir,\\' replied the constable, coughing with great\\r , violence; for he had finished his ale in a hurry, and some of it had\\r , gone the wrong way.\\r , \\r , \\'Here\\'s the house broken into,\\' said the doctor, \\'and a couple of men\\r , catch one moment\\'s glimpse of a boy, in the midst of gunpowder smoke,\\r , and in all the distraction of alarm and darkness.  Here\\'s a boy comes\\r , to that very same house, next morning, and because he happens to have\\r , his arm tied up, these men lay violent hands upon him--by doing which,\\r , they place his life in great danger--and swear he is the thief.  Now,\\r , the question is, whether these men are justified by the fact; if not,\\r , in what situation do they place themselves?\\'\\r , \\r , The constable nodded profoundly.  He said, if that wasn\\'t law, he would\\r , be glad to know what was.\\r , \\r , \\'I ask you again,\\' thundered the doctor, \\'are you, on your solemn\\r , oaths, able to identify that boy?\\'\\r , \\r , Brittles looked doubtfully at Mr. Giles; Mr. Giles looked doubtfully at\\r , Brittles; the constable put his hand behind his ear, to catch the\\r , reply; the two women and the tinker leaned forward to listen; the\\r , doctor glanced keenly round; when a ring was heard at the gate, and at\\r , the same moment, the sound of wheels.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s the runners!\\' cried Brittles, to all appearance much relieved.\\r , \\r , \\'The what?\\' exclaimed the doctor, aghast in his turn.\\r , \\r , \\'The Bow Street officers, sir,\\' replied Brittles, taking up a candle;\\r , \\'me and Mr. Giles sent for \\'em this morning.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What?\\' cried the doctor.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' replied Brittles; \\'I sent a message up by the coachman, and I\\r , only wonder they weren\\'t here before, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You did, did you?  Then confound your--slow coaches down here; that\\'s\\r , all,\\' said the doctor, walking away.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXXI\\r , \\r , INVOLVES A CRITICAL POSITION\\r , \\r , \\'Who\\'s that?\\' inquired Brittles, opening the door a little way, with\\r , the chain up, and peeping out, shading the candle with his hand.\\r , \\r , \\'Open the door,\\' replied a man outside; \\'it\\'s the officers from Bow\\r , Street, as was sent to to-day.\\'\\r , \\r , Much comforted by this assurance, Brittles opened the door to its full\\r , width, and confronted a portly man in a great-coat; who walked in,\\r , without saying anything more, and wiped his shoes on the mat, as coolly\\r , as if he lived there.\\r , \\r , \\'Just send somebody out to relieve my mate, will you, young man?\\' said\\r , the officer; \\'he\\'s in the gig, a-minding the prad.  Have you got a\\r , coach \\'us here, that you could put it up in, for five or ten minutes?\\'\\r , \\r , Brittles replying in the affirmative, and pointing out the building,\\r , the portly man stepped back to the garden-gate, and helped his\\r , companion to put up the gig:  while Brittles lighted them, in a state\\r , of great admiration.  This done, they returned to the house, and, being\\r , shown into a parlour, took off their great-coats and hats, and showed\\r , like what they were.\\r , \\r , The man who had knocked at the door, was a stout personage of middle\\r , height, aged about fifty: with shiny black hair, cropped pretty close;\\r , half-whiskers, a round face, and sharp eyes.  The other was a\\r , red-headed, bony man, in top-boots; with a rather ill-favoured\\r , countenance, and a turned-up sinister-looking nose.\\r , \\r , \\'Tell your governor that Blathers and Duff is here, will you?\\' said the\\r , stouter man, smoothing down his hair, and laying a pair of handcuffs on\\r , the table.  \\'Oh!  Good-evening, master.  Can I have a word or two with\\r , you in private, if you please?\\'\\r , \\r , This was addressed to Mr. Losberne, who now made his appearance; that\\r , gentleman, motioning Brittles to retire, brought in the two ladies, and\\r , shut the door.\\r , \\r , \\'This is the lady of the house,\\' said Mr. Losberne, motioning towards\\r , Mrs. Maylie.\\r , \\r , Mr. Blathers made a bow.  Being desired to sit down, he put his hat on\\r , the floor, and taking a chair, motioned to Duff to do the same.  The\\r , latter gentleman, who did not appear quite so much accustomed to good\\r , society, or quite so much at his ease in it--one of the two--seated\\r , himself, after undergoing several muscular affections of the limbs, and\\r , the head of his stick into his mouth, with some embarrassment.\\r , \\r , \\'Now, with regard to this here robbery, master,\\' said Blathers. \\'What\\r , are the circumstances?\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Losberne, who appeared desirous of gaining time, recounted them at\\r , great length, and with much circumlocution.  Messrs. Blathers and Duff\\r , looked very knowing meanwhile, and occasionally exchanged a nod.\\r , \\r , \\'I can\\'t say, for certain, till I see the work, of course,\\' said\\r , Blathers; \\'but my opinion at once is,--I don\\'t mind committing myself\\r , to that extent,--that this wasn\\'t done by a yokel; eh, Duff?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Certainly not,\\' replied Duff.\\r , \\r , \\'And, translating the word yokel for the benefit of the ladies, I\\r , apprehend your meaning to be, that this attempt was not made by a\\r , countryman?\\' said Mr. Losberne, with a smile.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s it, master,\\' replied Blathers.  \\'This is all about the robbery,\\r , is it?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'All,\\' replied the doctor.\\r , \\r , \\'Now, what is this, about this here boy that the servants are a-talking\\r , on?\\' said Blathers.\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing at all,\\' replied the doctor.  \\'One of the frightened servants\\r , chose to take it into his head, that he had something to do with this\\r , attempt to break into the house; but it\\'s nonsense: sheer absurdity.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Wery easy disposed of, if it is,\\' remarked Duff.\\r , \\r , \\'What he says is quite correct,\\' observed Blathers, nodding his head in\\r , a confirmatory way, and playing carelessly with the handcuffs, as if\\r , they were a pair of castanets.  \\'Who is the boy? What account does he\\r , give of himself?  Where did he come from? He didn\\'t drop out of the\\r , clouds, did he, master?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Of course not,\\' replied the doctor, with a nervous glance at the two\\r , ladies.  \\'I know his whole history: but we can talk about that\\r , presently.  You would like, first, to see the place where the thieves\\r , made their attempt, I suppose?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Certainly,\\' rejoined Mr. Blathers.  \\'We had better inspect the\\r , premises first, and examine the servants afterwards. That\\'s the usual\\r , way of doing business.\\'\\r , \\r , Lights were then procured; and Messrs. Blathers and Duff, attended by\\r , the native constable, Brittles, Giles, and everybody else in short,\\r , went into the little room at the end of the passage and looked out at\\r , the window; and afterwards went round by way of the lawn, and looked in\\r , at the window; and after that, had a candle handed out to inspect the\\r , shutter with; and after that, a lantern to trace the footsteps with;\\r , and after that, a pitchfork to poke the bushes with.  This done, amidst\\r , the breathless interest of all beholders, they came in again; and Mr.\\r , Giles and Brittles were put through a melodramatic representation of\\r , their share in the previous night\\'s adventures: which they performed\\r , some six times over: contradicting each other, in not more than one\\r , important respect, the first time, and in not more than a dozen the\\r , last.  This consummation being arrived at, Blathers and Duff cleared\\r , the room, and held a long council together, compared with which, for\\r , secrecy and solemnity, a consultation of great doctors on the knottiest\\r , point in medicine, would be mere child\\'s play.\\r , \\r , Meanwhile, the doctor walked up and down the next room in a very uneasy\\r , state; and Mrs. Maylie and Rose looked on, with anxious faces.\\r , \\r , \\'Upon my word,\\' he said, making a halt, after a great number of very\\r , rapid turns, \\'I hardly know what to do.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Surely,\\' said Rose, \\'the poor child\\'s story, faithfully repeated to\\r , these men, will be sufficient to exonerate him.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I doubt it, my dear young lady,\\' said the doctor, shaking his head.\\r , \\'I don\\'t think it would exonerate him, either with them, or with legal\\r , functionaries of a higher grade.  What is he, after all, they would\\r , say?  A runaway.  Judged by mere worldly considerations and\\r , probabilities, his story is a very doubtful one.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You believe it, surely?\\' interrupted Rose.\\r , \\r , \\'_I_ believe it, strange as it is; and perhaps I may be an old fool for\\r , doing so,\\' rejoined the doctor; \\'but I don\\'t think it is exactly the\\r , tale for a practical police-officer, nevertheless.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why not?\\' demanded Rose.\\r , \\r , \\'Because, my pretty cross-examiner,\\' replied the doctor: \\'because,\\r , viewed with their eyes, there are many ugly points about it; he can\\r , only prove the parts that look ill, and none of those that look well.\\r , Confound the fellows, they _will_ have the why and the wherefore, and\\r , will take nothing for granted.  On his own showing, you see, he has\\r , been the companion of thieves for some time past; he has been carried\\r , to a police-officer, on a charge of picking a gentleman\\'s pocket; he\\r , has been taken away, forcibly, from that gentleman\\'s house, to a place\\r , which he cannot describe or point out, and of the situation of which he\\r , has not the remotest idea.  He is brought down to Chertsey, by men who\\r , seem to have taken a violent fancy to him, whether he will or no; and\\r , is put through a window to rob a house; and then, just at the very\\r , moment when he is going to alarm the inmates, and so do the very thing\\r , that would set him all to rights, there rushes into the way, a\\r , blundering dog of a half-bred butler, and shoots him! As if on purpose\\r , to prevent his doing any good for himself! Don\\'t you see all this?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I see it, of course,\\' replied Rose, smiling at the doctor\\'s\\r , impetuosity; \\'but still I do not see anything in it, to criminate the\\r , poor child.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' replied the doctor; \\'of course not!  Bless the bright eyes of\\r , your sex!  They never see, whether for good or bad, more than one side\\r , of any question; and that is, always, the one which first presents\\r , itself to them.\\'\\r , \\r , Having given vent to this result of experience, the doctor put his\\r , hands into his pockets, and walked up and down the room with even\\r , greater rapidity than before.\\r , \\r , \\'The more I think of it,\\' said the doctor, \\'the more I see that it will\\r , occasion endless trouble and difficulty if we put these men in\\r , possession of the boy\\'s real story.  I am certain it will not be\\r , believed; and even if they can do nothing to him in the end, still the\\r , dragging it forward, and giving publicity to all the doubts that will\\r , be cast upon it, must interfere, materially, with your benevolent plan\\r , of rescuing him from misery.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh! what is to be done?\\' cried Rose.  \\'Dear, dear! why did they send\\r , for these people?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why, indeed!\\' exclaimed Mrs. Maylie.  \\'I would not have had them here,\\r , for the world.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'All I know is,\\' said Mr. Losberne, at last:  sitting down with a kind\\r , of desperate calmness, \\'that we must try and carry it off with a bold\\r , face.  The object is a good one, and that must be our excuse.  The boy\\r , has strong symptoms of fever upon him, and is in no condition to be\\r , talked to any more; that\\'s one comfort.  We must make the best of it;\\r , and if bad be the best, it is no fault of ours.  Come in!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, master,\\' said Blathers, entering the room followed by his\\r , colleague, and making the door fast, before he said any more. \\'This\\r , warn\\'t a put-up thing.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And what the devil\\'s a put-up thing?\\' demanded the doctor, impatiently.\\r , \\r , \\'We call it a put-up robbery, ladies,\\' said Blathers, turning to them,\\r , as if he pitied their ignorance, but had a contempt for the doctor\\'s,\\r , \\'when the servants is in it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nobody suspected them, in this case,\\' said Mrs. Maylie.\\r , \\r , \\'Wery likely not, ma\\'am,\\' replied Blathers; \\'but they might have been\\r , in it, for all that.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'More likely on that wery account,\\' said Duff.\\r , \\r , \\'We find it was a town hand,\\' said Blathers, continuing his report;\\r , \\'for the style of work is first-rate.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Wery pretty indeed it is,\\' remarked Duff, in an undertone.\\r , \\r , \\'There was two of \\'em in it,\\' continued Blathers; \\'and they had a boy\\r , with \\'em; that\\'s plain from the size of the window.  That\\'s all to be\\r , said at present.  We\\'ll see this lad that you\\'ve got upstairs at once,\\r , if you please.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Perhaps they will take something to drink first, Mrs. Maylie?\\' said\\r , the doctor: his face brightening, as if some new thought had occurred\\r , to him.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh! to be sure!\\' exclaimed Rose, eagerly.  \\'You shall have it\\r , immediately, if you will.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why, thank you, miss!\\' said Blathers, drawing his coat-sleeve across\\r , his mouth; \\'it\\'s dry work, this sort of duty.  Anythink that\\'s handy,\\r , miss; don\\'t put yourself out of the way, on our accounts.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What shall it be?\\' asked the doctor, following the young lady to the\\r , sideboard.\\r , \\r , \\'A little drop of spirits, master, if it\\'s all the same,\\' replied\\r , Blathers.  \\'It\\'s a cold ride from London, ma\\'am; and I always find that\\r , spirits comes home warmer to the feelings.\\'\\r , \\r , This interesting communication was addressed to Mrs. Maylie, who\\r , received it very graciously.  While it was being conveyed to her, the\\r , doctor slipped out of the room.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!\\' said Mr. Blathers:  not holding his wine-glass by the stem, but\\r , grasping the bottom between the thumb and forefinger of his left hand:\\r , and placing it in front of his chest; \\'I have seen a good many pieces\\r , of business like this, in my time, ladies.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That crack down in the back lane at Edmonton, Blathers,\\' said Mr.\\r , Duff, assisting his colleague\\'s memory.\\r , \\r , \\'That was something in this way, warn\\'t it?\\' rejoined Mr. Blathers;\\r , \\'that was done by Conkey Chickweed, that was.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You always gave that to him\\' replied Duff.  \\'It was the Family Pet, I\\r , tell you.  Conkey hadn\\'t any more to do with it than I had.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Get out!\\' retorted Mr. Blathers; \\'I know better.  Do you mind that\\r , time when Conkey was robbed of his money, though?  What a start that\\r , was!  Better than any novel-book _I_ ever see!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What was that?\\' inquired Rose:  anxious to encourage any symptoms of\\r , good-humour in the unwelcome visitors.\\r , \\r , \\'It was a robbery, miss, that hardly anybody would have been down\\r , upon,\\' said Blathers.  \\'This here Conkey Chickweed--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Conkey means Nosey, ma\\'am,\\' interposed Duff.\\r , \\r , \\'Of course the lady knows that, don\\'t she?\\' demanded Mr. Blathers.\\r , \\'Always interrupting, you are, partner!  This here Conkey Chickweed,\\r , miss, kept a public-house over Battlebridge way, and he had a cellar,\\r , where a good many young lords went to see cock-fighting, and\\r , badger-drawing, and that; and a wery intellectual manner the sports was\\r , conducted in, for I\\'ve seen \\'em off\\'en.  He warn\\'t one of the family,\\r , at that time; and one night he was robbed of three hundred and\\r , twenty-seven guineas in a canvas bag, that was stole out of his bedroom\\r , in the dead of night, by a tall man with a black patch over his eye,\\r , who had concealed himself under the bed, and after committing the\\r , robbery, jumped slap out of window:  which was only a story high. He\\r , was wery quick about it.  But Conkey was quick, too; for he fired a\\r , blunderbuss arter him, and roused the neighbourhood. They set up a\\r , hue-and-cry, directly, and when they came to look about \\'em, found that\\r , Conkey had hit the robber; for there was traces of blood, all the way\\r , to some palings a good distance off; and there they lost \\'em.  However,\\r , he had made off with the blunt; and, consequently, the name of Mr.\\r , Chickweed, licensed witler, appeared in the Gazette among the other\\r , bankrupts; and all manner of benefits and subscriptions, and I don\\'t\\r , know what all, was got up for the poor man, who was in a wery low state\\r , of mind about his loss, and went up and down the streets, for three or\\r , four days, a pulling his hair off in such a desperate manner that many\\r , people was afraid he might be going to make away with himself. One day\\r , he came up to the office, all in a hurry, and had a private interview\\r , with the magistrate, who, after a deal of talk, rings the bell, and\\r , orders Jem Spyers in (Jem was a active officer), and tells him to go\\r , and assist Mr. Chickweed in apprehending the man as robbed his house.\\r , \"I see him, Spyers,\" said Chickweed, \"pass my house yesterday morning,\"\\r , \"Why didn\\'t you up, and collar him!\" says Spyers.  \"I was so struck all\\r , of a heap, that you might have fractured my skull with a toothpick,\"\\r , says the poor man; \"but we\\'re sure to have him; for between ten and\\r , eleven o\\'clock at night he passed again.\"  Spyers no sooner heard this,\\r , than he put some clean linen and a comb, in his pocket, in case he\\r , should have to stop a day or two; and away he goes, and sets himself\\r , down at one of the public-house windows behind the little red curtain,\\r , with his hat on, all ready to bolt out, at a moment\\'s notice. He was\\r , smoking his pipe here, late at night, when all of a sudden Chickweed\\r , roars out, \"Here he is! Stop thief!  Murder!\"  Jem Spyers dashes out;\\r , and there he sees Chickweed, a-tearing down the street full cry.  Away\\r , goes Spyers; on goes Chickweed; round turns the people; everybody roars\\r , out, \"Thieves!\" and Chickweed himself keeps on shouting, all the time,\\r , like mad.  Spyers loses sight of him a minute as he turns a corner;\\r , shoots round; sees a little crowd; dives in; \"Which is the man?\"\\r , \"D--me!\" says Chickweed, \"I\\'ve lost him again!\"  It was a remarkable\\r , occurrence, but he warn\\'t to be seen nowhere, so they went back to the\\r , public-house. Next morning, Spyers took his old place, and looked out,\\r , from behind the curtain, for a tall man with a black patch over his\\r , eye, till his own two eyes ached again.  At last, he couldn\\'t help\\r , shutting \\'em, to ease \\'em a minute; and the very moment he did so, he\\r , hears Chickweed a-roaring out, \"Here he is!\"  Off he starts once more,\\r , with Chickweed half-way down the street ahead of him; and after twice\\r , as long a run as the yesterday\\'s one, the man\\'s lost again!  This was\\r , done, once or twice more, till one-half the neighbours gave out that\\r , Mr. Chickweed had been robbed by the devil, who was playing tricks with\\r , him arterwards; and the other half, that poor Mr. Chickweed had gone\\r , mad with grief.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What did Jem Spyers say?\\' inquired the doctor; who had returned to the\\r , room shortly after the commencement of the story.\\r , \\r , \\'Jem Spyers,\\' resumed the officer, \\'for a long time said nothing at\\r , all, and listened to everything without seeming to, which showed he\\r , understood his business.  But, one morning, he walked into the bar, and\\r , taking out his snuffbox, says \"Chickweed, I\\'ve found out who done this\\r , here robbery.\"  \"Have you?\" said Chickweed.  \"Oh, my dear Spyers, only\\r , let me have wengeance, and I shall die contented!  Oh, my dear Spyers,\\r , where is the villain!\"  \"Come!\" said Spyers, offering him a pinch of\\r , snuff, \"none of that gammon!  You did it yourself.\"  So he had; and a\\r , good bit of money he had made by it, too; and nobody would never have\\r , found it out, if he hadn\\'t been so precious anxious to keep up\\r , appearances!\\' said Mr. Blathers, putting down his wine-glass, and\\r , clinking the handcuffs together.\\r , \\r , \\'Very curious, indeed,\\' observed the doctor.  \\'Now, if you please, you\\r , can walk upstairs.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If _you_ please, sir,\\' returned Mr. Blathers.  Closely following Mr.\\r , Losberne, the two officers ascended to Oliver\\'s bedroom; Mr. Giles\\r , preceding the party, with a lighted candle.\\r , \\r , Oliver had been dozing; but looked worse, and was more feverish than he\\r , had appeared yet.  Being assisted by the doctor, he managed to sit up\\r , in bed for a minute or so; and looked at the strangers without at all\\r , understanding what was going forward--in fact, without seeming to\\r , recollect where he was, or what had been passing.\\r , \\r , \\'This,\\' said Mr. Losberne, speaking softly, but with great vehemence\\r , notwithstanding, \\'this is the lad, who, being accidently wounded by a\\r , spring-gun in some boyish trespass on Mr. What-d\\' ye-call-him\\'s\\r , grounds, at the back here, comes to the house for assistance this\\r , morning, and is immediately laid hold of and maltreated, by that\\r , ingenious gentleman with the candle in his hand:  who has placed his\\r , life in considerable danger, as I can professionally certify.\\'\\r , \\r , Messrs. Blathers and Duff looked at Mr. Giles, as he was thus\\r , recommended to their notice.  The bewildered butler gazed from them\\r , towards Oliver, and from Oliver towards Mr. Losberne, with a most\\r , ludicrous mixture of fear and perplexity.\\r , \\r , \\'You don\\'t mean to deny that, I suppose?\\' said the doctor, laying\\r , Oliver gently down again.\\r , \\r , \\'It was all done for the--for the best, sir,\\' answered Giles. \\'I am\\r , sure I thought it was the boy, or I wouldn\\'t have meddled with him.  I\\r , am not of an inhuman disposition, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Thought it was what boy?\\' inquired the senior officer.\\r , \\r , \\'The housebreaker\\'s boy, sir!\\' replied Giles.  \\'They--they certainly\\r , had a boy.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well?  Do you think so now?\\' inquired Blathers.\\r , \\r , \\'Think what, now?\\' replied Giles, looking vacantly at his questioner.\\r , \\r , \\'Think it\\'s the same boy, Stupid-head?\\' rejoined Blathers, impatiently.\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t know; I really don\\'t know,\\' said Giles, with a rueful\\r , countenance.  \\'I couldn\\'t swear to him.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What do you think?\\' asked Mr. Blathers.\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t know what to think,\\' replied poor Giles.  \\'I don\\'t think it is\\r , the boy; indeed, I\\'m almost certain that it isn\\'t.  You know it can\\'t\\r , be.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Has this man been a-drinking, sir?\\' inquired Blathers, turning to the\\r , doctor.\\r , \\r , \\'What a precious muddle-headed chap you are!\\' said Duff, addressing Mr.\\r , Giles, with supreme contempt.\\r , \\r , Mr. Losberne had been feeling the patient\\'s pulse during this short\\r , dialogue; but he now rose from the chair by the bedside, and remarked,\\r , that if the officers had any doubts upon the subject, they would\\r , perhaps like to step into the next room, and have Brittles before them.\\r , \\r , Acting upon this suggestion, they adjourned to a neighbouring\\r , apartment, where Mr. Brittles, being called in, involved himself and\\r , his respected superior in such a wonderful maze of fresh contradictions\\r , and impossibilities, as tended to throw no particular light on\\r , anything, but the fact of his own strong mystification; except, indeed,\\r , his declarations that he shouldn\\'t know the real boy, if he were put\\r , before him that instant; that he had only taken Oliver to be he,\\r , because Mr. Giles had said he was; and that Mr. Giles had, five minutes\\r , previously, admitted in the kitchen, that he began to be very much\\r , afraid he had been a little too hasty.\\r , \\r , Among other ingenious surmises, the question was then raised, whether\\r , Mr. Giles had really hit anybody; and upon examination of the fellow\\r , pistol to that which he had fired, it turned out to have no more\\r , destructive loading than gunpowder and brown paper: a discovery which\\r , made a considerable impression on everybody but the doctor, who had\\r , drawn the ball about ten minutes before. Upon no one, however, did it\\r , make a greater impression than on Mr. Giles himself; who, after\\r , labouring, for some hours, under the fear of having mortally wounded a\\r , fellow-creature, eagerly caught at this new idea, and favoured it to\\r , the utmost.  Finally, the officers, without troubling themselves very\\r , much about Oliver, left the Chertsey constable in the house, and took\\r , up their rest for that night in the town; promising to return the next\\r , morning.\\r , \\r , With the next morning, there came a rumour, that two men and a boy were\\r , in the cage at Kingston, who had been apprehended over night under\\r , suspicious circumstances; and to Kingston Messrs. Blathers and Duff\\r , journeyed accordingly. The suspicious circumstances, however, resolving\\r , themselves, on investigation, into the one fact, that they had been\\r , discovered sleeping under a haystack; which, although a great crime, is\\r , only punishable by imprisonment, and is, in the merciful eye of the\\r , English law, and its comprehensive love of all the King\\'s subjects,\\r , held to be no satisfactory proof, in the absence of all other evidence,\\r , that the sleeper, or sleepers, have committed burglary accompanied with\\r , violence, and have therefore rendered themselves liable to the\\r , punishment of death; Messrs. Blathers and Duff came back again, as wise\\r , as they went.\\r , \\r , In short, after some more examination, and a great deal more\\r , conversation, a neighbouring magistrate was readily induced to take the\\r , joint bail of Mrs. Maylie and Mr. Losberne for Oliver\\'s appearance if\\r , he should ever be called upon; and Blathers and Duff, being rewarded\\r , with a couple of guineas, returned to town with divided opinions on the\\r , subject of their expedition: the latter gentleman on a mature\\r , consideration of all the circumstances, inclining to the belief that\\r , the burglarious attempt had originated with the Family Pet; and the\\r , former being equally disposed to concede the full merit of it to the\\r , great Mr. Conkey Chickweed.\\r , \\r , Meanwhile, Oliver gradually throve and prospered under the united care\\r , of Mrs. Maylie, Rose, and the kind-hearted Mr. Losberne.  If fervent\\r , prayers, gushing from hearts overcharged with gratitude, be heard in\\r , heaven--and if they be not, what prayers are!--the blessings which the\\r , orphan child called down upon them, sunk into their souls, diffusing\\r , peace and happiness.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXXII\\r , \\r , OF THE HAPPY LIFE OLIVER BEGAN TO LEAD WITH HIS KIND FRIENDS\\r , \\r , Oliver\\'s ailings were neither slight nor few.  In addition to the pain\\r , and delay attendant on a broken limb, his exposure to the wet and cold\\r , had brought on fever and ague:  which hung about him for many weeks,\\r , and reduced him sadly. But, at length, he began, by slow degrees, to\\r , get better, and to be able to say sometimes, in a few tearful words,\\r , how deeply he felt the goodness of the two sweet ladies, and how\\r , ardently he hoped that when he grew strong and well again, he could do\\r , something to show his gratitude; only something, which would let them\\r , see the love and duty with which his breast was full; something,\\r , however slight, which would prove to them that their gentle kindness\\r , had not been cast away; but that the poor boy whom their charity had\\r , rescued from misery, or death, was eager to serve them with his whole\\r , heart and soul.\\r , \\r , \\'Poor fellow!\\' said Rose, when Oliver had been one day feebly\\r , endeavouring to utter the words of thankfulness that rose to his pale\\r , lips; \\'you shall have many opportunities of serving us, if you will.\\r , We are going into the country, and my aunt intends that you shall\\r , accompany us.  The quiet place, the pure air, and all the pleasure and\\r , beauties of spring, will restore you in a few days.  We will employ you\\r , in a hundred ways, when you can bear the trouble.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The trouble!\\' cried Oliver.  \\'Oh! dear lady, if I could but work for\\r , you; if I could only give you pleasure by watering your flowers, or\\r , watching your birds, or running up and down the whole day long, to make\\r , you happy; what would I give to do it!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You shall give nothing at all,\\' said Miss Maylie, smiling; \\'for, as I\\r , told you before, we shall employ you in a hundred ways; and if you only\\r , take half the trouble to please us, that you promise now, you will make\\r , me very happy indeed.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Happy, ma\\'am!\\' cried Oliver; \\'how kind of you to say so!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You will make me happier than I can tell you,\\' replied the young lady.\\r , \\'To think that my dear good aunt should have been the means of rescuing\\r , any one from such sad misery as you have described to us, would be an\\r , unspeakable pleasure to me; but to know that the object of her goodness\\r , and compassion was sincerely grateful and attached, in consequence,\\r , would delight me, more than you can well imagine.  Do you understand\\r , me?\\' she inquired, watching Oliver\\'s thoughtful face.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh yes, ma\\'am, yes!\\' replied Oliver eagerly; \\'but I was thinking that\\r , I am ungrateful now.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'To whom?\\' inquired the young lady.\\r , \\r , \\'To the kind gentleman, and the dear old nurse, who took so much care\\r , of me before,\\' rejoined Oliver.  \\'If they knew how happy I am, they\\r , would be pleased, I am sure.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I am sure they would,\\' rejoined Oliver\\'s benefactress; \\'and Mr.\\r , Losberne has already been kind enough to promise that when you are well\\r , enough to bear the journey, he will carry you to see them.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Has he, ma\\'am?\\' cried Oliver, his face brightening with pleasure.  \\'I\\r , don\\'t know what I shall do for joy when I see their kind faces once\\r , again!\\'\\r , \\r , In a short time Oliver was sufficiently recovered to undergo the\\r , fatigue of this expedition.  One morning he and Mr. Losberne set out,\\r , accordingly, in a little carriage which belonged to Mrs. Maylie.  When\\r , they came to Chertsey Bridge, Oliver turned very pale, and uttered a\\r , loud exclamation.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s the matter with the boy?\\' cried the doctor, as usual, all in a\\r , bustle.  \\'Do you see anything--hear anything--feel anything--eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That, sir,\\' cried Oliver, pointing out of the carriage window. \\'That\\r , house!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes; well, what of it?  Stop coachman.  Pull up here,\\' cried the\\r , doctor.  \\'What of the house, my man; eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The thieves--the house they took me to!\\' whispered Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'The devil it is!\\' cried the doctor.  \\'Hallo, there! let me out!\\'\\r , \\r , But, before the coachman could dismount from his box, he had tumbled\\r , out of the coach, by some means or other; and, running down to the\\r , deserted tenement, began kicking at the door like a madman.\\r , \\r , \\'Halloa?\\' said a little ugly hump-backed man:  opening the door so\\r , suddenly, that the doctor, from the very impetus of his last kick,\\r , nearly fell forward into the passage. \\'What\\'s the matter here?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Matter!\\' exclaimed the other, collaring him, without a moment\\'s\\r , reflection.  \\'A good deal.  Robbery is the matter.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'There\\'ll be Murder the matter, too,\\' replied the hump-backed man,\\r , coolly, \\'if you don\\'t take your hands off.  Do you hear me?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I hear you,\\' said the doctor, giving his captive a hearty shake.\\r , \\r , \\'Where\\'s--confound the fellow, what\\'s his rascally name--Sikes; that\\'s\\r , it.  Where\\'s Sikes, you thief?\\'\\r , \\r , The hump-backed man stared, as if in excess of amazement and\\r , indignation; then, twisting himself, dexterously, from the doctor\\'s\\r , grasp, growled forth a volley of horrid oaths, and retired into the\\r , house.  Before he could shut the door, however, the doctor had passed\\r , into the parlour, without a word of parley.\\r , \\r , He looked anxiously round; not an article of furniture; not a vestige\\r , of anything, animate or inanimate; not even the position of the\\r , cupboards; answered Oliver\\'s description!\\r , \\r , \\'Now!\\' said the hump-backed man, who had watched him keenly, \\'what do\\r , you mean by coming into my house, in this violent way? Do you want to\\r , rob me, or to murder me?  Which is it?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Did you ever know a man come out to do either, in a chariot and pair,\\r , you ridiculous old vampire?\\' said the irritable doctor.\\r , \\r , \\'What do you want, then?\\' demanded the hunchback.  \\'Will you take\\r , yourself off, before I do you a mischief?  Curse you!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'As soon as I think proper,\\' said Mr. Losberne, looking into the other\\r , parlour; which, like the first, bore no resemblance whatever to\\r , Oliver\\'s account of it.  \\'I shall find you out, some day, my friend.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Will you?\\' sneered the ill-favoured cripple.  \\'If you ever want me,\\r , I\\'m here.  I haven\\'t lived here mad and all alone, for five-and-twenty\\r , years, to be scared by you.  You shall pay for this; you shall pay for\\r , this.\\'  And so saying, the mis-shapen little demon set up a yell, and\\r , danced upon the ground, as if wild with rage.\\r , \\r , \\'Stupid enough, this,\\' muttered the doctor to himself; \\'the boy must\\r , have made a mistake.  Here!  Put that in your pocket, and shut yourself\\r , up again.\\'  With these words he flung the hunchback a piece of money,\\r , and returned to the carriage.\\r , \\r , The man followed to the chariot door, uttering the wildest imprecations\\r , and curses all the way; but as Mr. Losberne turned to speak to the\\r , driver, he looked into the carriage, and eyed Oliver for an instant\\r , with a glance so sharp and fierce and at the same time so furious and\\r , vindictive, that, waking or sleeping, he could not forget it for months\\r , afterwards.  He continued to utter the most fearful imprecations, until\\r , the driver had resumed his seat; and when they were once more on their\\r , way, they could see him some distance behind: beating his feet upon the\\r , ground, and tearing his hair, in transports of real or pretended rage.\\r , \\r , \\'I am an ass!\\' said the doctor, after a long silence.  \\'Did you know\\r , that before, Oliver?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then don\\'t forget it another time.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'An ass,\\' said the doctor again, after a further silence of some\\r , minutes.  \\'Even if it had been the right place, and the right fellows\\r , had been there, what could I have done, single-handed? And if I had had\\r , assistance, I see no good that I should have done, except leading to my\\r , own exposure, and an unavoidable statement of the manner in which I\\r , have hushed up this business. That would have served me right, though.\\r , I am always involving myself in some scrape or other, by acting on\\r , impulse.  It might have done me good.\\'\\r , \\r , Now, the fact was that the excellent doctor had never acted upon\\r , anything but impulse all through his life, and it was no bad compliment\\r , to the nature of the impulses which governed him, that so far from\\r , being involved in any peculiar troubles or misfortunes, he had the\\r , warmest respect and esteem of all who knew him.  If the truth must be\\r , told, he was a little out of temper, for a minute or two, at being\\r , disappointed in procuring corroborative evidence of Oliver\\'s story on\\r , the very first occasion on which he had a chance of obtaining any.  He\\r , soon came round again, however; and finding that Oliver\\'s replies to\\r , his questions, were still as straightforward and consistent, and still\\r , delivered with as much apparent sincerity and truth, as they had ever\\r , been, he made up his mind to attach full credence to them, from that\\r , time forth.\\r , \\r , As Oliver knew the name of the street in which Mr. Brownlow resided,\\r , they were enabled to drive straight thither.  When the coach turned\\r , into it, his heart beat so violently, that he could scarcely draw his\\r , breath.\\r , \\r , \\'Now, my boy, which house is it?\\' inquired Mr. Losberne.\\r , \\r , \\'That!  That!\\' replied Oliver, pointing eagerly out of the window.\\r , \\'The white house.  Oh! make haste!  Pray make haste! I feel as if I\\r , should die: it makes me tremble so.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Come, come!\\' said the good doctor, patting him on the shoulder. \\'You\\r , will see them directly, and they will be overjoyed to find you safe and\\r , well.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh!  I hope so!\\' cried Oliver.  \\'They were so good to me; so very,\\r , very good to me.\\'\\r , \\r , The coach rolled on.  It stopped.  No; that was the wrong house; the\\r , next door.  It went on a few paces, and stopped again. Oliver looked up\\r , at the windows, with tears of happy expectation coursing down his face.\\r , \\r , Alas! the white house was empty, and there was a bill in the window.\\r , \\'To Let.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Knock at the next door,\\' cried Mr. Losberne, taking Oliver\\'s arm in\\r , his.  \\'What has become of Mr. Brownlow, who used to live in the\\r , adjoining house, do you know?\\'\\r , \\r , The servant did not know; but would go and inquire.  She presently\\r , returned, and said, that Mr. Brownlow had sold off his goods, and gone\\r , to the West Indies, six weeks before.  Oliver clasped his hands, and\\r , sank feebly backward.\\r , \\r , \\'Has his housekeeper gone too?\\' inquired Mr. Losberne, after a moment\\'s\\r , pause.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, sir\\'; replied the servant.  \\'The old gentleman, the housekeeper,\\r , and a gentleman who was a friend of Mr. Brownlow\\'s, all went together.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then turn towards home again,\\' said Mr. Losberne to the driver; \\'and\\r , don\\'t stop to bait the horses, till you get out of this confounded\\r , London!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The book-stall keeper, sir?\\' said Oliver.  \\'I know the way there.  See\\r , him, pray, sir!  Do see him!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'My poor boy, this is disappointment enough for one day,\\' said the\\r , doctor.  \\'Quite enough for both of us.  If we go to the book-stall\\r , keeper\\'s, we shall certainly find that he is dead, or has set his house\\r , on fire, or run away.  No; home again straight!\\'  And in obedience to\\r , the doctor\\'s impulse, home they went.\\r , \\r , This bitter disappointment caused Oliver much sorrow and grief, even in\\r , the midst of his happiness; for he had pleased himself, many times\\r , during his illness, with thinking of all that Mr. Brownlow and Mrs.\\r , Bedwin would say to him: and what delight it would be to tell them how\\r , many long days and nights he had passed in reflecting on what they had\\r , done for him, and in bewailing his cruel separation from them. The hope\\r , of eventually clearing himself with them, too, and explaining how he\\r , had been forced away, had buoyed him up, and sustained him, under many\\r , of his recent trials; and now, the idea that they should have gone so\\r , far, and carried with them the belief that he was an impostor and a\\r , robber--a belief which might remain uncontradicted to his dying\\r , day--was almost more than he could bear.\\r , \\r , The circumstance occasioned no alteration, however, in the behaviour of\\r , his benefactors.  After another fortnight, when the fine warm weather\\r , had fairly begun, and every tree and flower was putting forth its young\\r , leaves and rich blossoms, they made preparations for quitting the house\\r , at Chertsey, for some months.\\r , \\r , Sending the plate, which had so excited Fagin\\'s cupidity, to the\\r , banker\\'s; and leaving Giles and another servant in care of the house,\\r , they departed to a cottage at some distance in the country, and took\\r , Oliver with them.\\r , \\r , Who can describe the pleasure and delight, the peace of mind and soft\\r , tranquillity, the sickly boy felt in the balmy air, and among the green\\r , hills and rich woods, of an inland village!  Who can tell how scenes of\\r , peace and quietude sink into the minds of pain-worn dwellers in close\\r , and noisy places, and carry their own freshness, deep into their jaded\\r , hearts!  Men who have lived in crowded, pent-up streets, through lives\\r , of toil, and who have never wished for change; men, to whom custom has\\r , indeed been second nature, and who have come almost to love each brick\\r , and stone that formed the narrow boundaries of their daily walks; even\\r , they, with the hand of death upon them, have been known to yearn at\\r , last for one short glimpse of Nature\\'s face; and, carried far from the\\r , scenes of their old pains and pleasures, have seemed to pass at once\\r , into a new state of being.  Crawling forth, from day to day, to some\\r , green sunny spot, they have had such memories wakened up within them by\\r , the sight of the sky, and hill and plain, and glistening water, that a\\r , foretaste of heaven itself has soothed their quick decline, and they\\r , have sunk into their tombs, as peacefully as the sun whose setting they\\r , watched from their lonely chamber window but a few hours before, faded\\r , from their dim and feeble sight!  The memories which peaceful country\\r , scenes call up, are not of this world, nor of its thoughts and hopes.\\r , Their gentle influence may teach us how to weave fresh garlands for the\\r , graves of those we loved:  may purify our thoughts, and bear down\\r , before it old enmity and hatred; but beneath all this, there lingers,\\r , in the least reflective mind, a vague and half-formed consciousness of\\r , having held such feelings long before, in some remote and distant time,\\r , which calls up solemn thoughts of distant times to come, and bends down\\r , pride and worldliness beneath it.\\r , \\r , It was a lovely spot to which they repaired.  Oliver, whose days had\\r , been spent among squalid crowds, and in the midst of noise and\\r , brawling, seemed to enter on a new existence there.  The rose and\\r , honeysuckle clung to the cottage walls; the ivy crept round the trunks\\r , of the trees; and the garden-flowers perfumed the air with delicious\\r , odours.  Hard by, was a little churchyard; not crowded with tall\\r , unsightly gravestones, but full of humble mounds, covered with fresh\\r , turf and moss: beneath which, the old people of the village lay at\\r , rest.  Oliver often wandered here; and, thinking of the wretched grave\\r , in which his mother lay, would sometimes sit him down and sob unseen;\\r , but, when he raised his eyes to the deep sky overhead, he would cease\\r , to think of her as lying in the ground, and would weep for her, sadly,\\r , but without pain.\\r , \\r , It was a happy time.  The days were peaceful and serene; the nights\\r , brought with them neither fear nor care; no languishing in a wretched\\r , prison, or associating with wretched men; nothing but pleasant and\\r , happy thoughts.  Every morning he went to a white-headed old gentleman,\\r , who lived near the little church: who taught him to read better, and to\\r , write:  and who spoke so kindly, and took such pains, that Oliver could\\r , never try enough to please him.  Then, he would walk with Mrs. Maylie\\r , and Rose, and hear them talk of books; or perhaps sit near them, in\\r , some shady place, and listen whilst the young lady read: which he could\\r , have done, until it grew too dark to see the letters. Then, he had his\\r , own lesson for the next day to prepare; and at this, he would work\\r , hard, in a little room which looked into the garden, till evening came\\r , slowly on, when the ladies would walk out again, and he with them:\\r , listening with such pleasure to all they said:  and so happy if they\\r , wanted a flower that he could climb to reach, or had forgotten anything\\r , he could run to fetch: that he could never be quick enough about it.\\r , When it became quite dark, and they returned home, the young lady would\\r , sit down to the piano, and play some pleasant air, or sing, in a low\\r , and gentle voice, some old song which it pleased her aunt to hear.\\r , There would be no candles lighted at such times as these; and Oliver\\r , would sit by one of the windows, listening to the sweet music, in a\\r , perfect rapture.\\r , \\r , And when Sunday came, how differently the day was spent, from any way\\r , in which he had ever spent it yet! and how happily too; like all the\\r , other days in that most happy time!  There was the little church, in\\r , the morning, with the green leaves fluttering at the windows:  the\\r , birds singing without:  and the sweet-smelling air stealing in at the\\r , low porch, and filling the homely building with its fragrance. The poor\\r , people were so neat and clean, and knelt so reverently in prayer, that\\r , it seemed a pleasure, not a tedious duty, their assembling there\\r , together; and though the singing might be rude, it was real, and\\r , sounded more musical (to Oliver\\'s ears at least) than any he had ever\\r , heard in church before.  Then, there were the walks as usual, and many\\r , calls at the clean houses of the labouring men; and at night, Oliver\\r , read a chapter or two from the Bible, which he had been studying all\\r , the week, and in the performance of which duty he felt more proud and\\r , pleased, than if he had been the clergyman himself.\\r , \\r , In the morning, Oliver would be a-foot by six o\\'clock, roaming the\\r , fields, and plundering the hedges, far and wide, for nosegays of wild\\r , flowers, with which he would return laden, home; and which it took\\r , great care and consideration to arrange, to the best advantage, for the\\r , embellishment of the breakfast-table. There was fresh groundsel, too,\\r , for Miss Maylie\\'s birds, with which Oliver, who had been studying the\\r , subject under the able tuition of the village clerk, would decorate the\\r , cages, in the most approved taste. When the birds were made all spruce\\r , and smart for the day, there was usually some little commission of\\r , charity to execute in the village; or, failing that, there was rare\\r , cricket-playing, sometimes, on the green; or, failing that, there was\\r , always something to do in the garden, or about the plants, to which\\r , Oliver (who had studied this science also, under the same master, who\\r , was a gardener by trade,) applied himself with hearty good-will, until\\r , Miss Rose made her appearance:  when there were a thousand\\r , commendations to be bestowed on all he had done.\\r , \\r , So three months glided away; three months which, in the life of the\\r , most blessed and favoured of mortals, might have been unmingled\\r , happiness, and which, in Oliver\\'s were true felicity. With the purest\\r , and most amiable generosity on one side; and the truest, warmest,\\r , soul-felt gratitude on the other; it is no wonder that, by the end of\\r , that short time, Oliver Twist had become completely domesticated with\\r , the old lady and her niece, and that the fervent attachment of his\\r , young and sensitive heart, was repaid by their pride in, and attachment\\r , to, himself.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXXIII\\r , \\r , WHEREIN THE HAPPINESS OF OLIVER AND HIS FRIENDS, EXPERIENCES A SUDDEN\\r , CHECK\\r , \\r , Spring flew swiftly by, and summer came.  If the village had been\\r , beautiful at first it was now in the full glow and luxuriance of its\\r , richness.  The great trees, which had looked shrunken and bare in the\\r , earlier months, had now burst into strong life and health; and\\r , stretching forth their green arms over the thirsty ground, converted\\r , open and naked spots into choice nooks, where was a deep and pleasant\\r , shade from which to look upon the wide prospect, steeped in sunshine,\\r , which lay stretched beyond.  The earth had donned her mantle of\\r , brightest green; and shed her richest perfumes abroad.  It was the\\r , prime and vigour of the year; all things were glad and flourishing.\\r , \\r , Still, the same quiet life went on at the little cottage, and the same\\r , cheerful serenity prevailed among its inmates.  Oliver had long since\\r , grown stout and healthy; but health or sickness made no difference in\\r , his warm feelings of a great many people.  He was still the same\\r , gentle, attached, affectionate creature that he had been when pain and\\r , suffering had wasted his strength, and when he was dependent for every\\r , slight attention, and comfort on those who tended him.\\r , \\r , One beautiful night, when they had taken a longer walk than was\\r , customary with them:  for the day had been unusually warm, and there\\r , was a brilliant moon, and a light wind had sprung up, which was\\r , unusually refreshing.  Rose had been in high spirits, too, and they had\\r , walked on, in merry conversation, until they had far exceeded their\\r , ordinary bounds.  Mrs. Maylie being fatigued, they returned more slowly\\r , home.  The young lady merely throwing off her simple bonnet, sat down\\r , to the piano as usual.  After running abstractedly over the keys for a\\r , few minutes, she fell into a low and very solemn air; and as she played\\r , it, they heard a sound as if she were weeping.\\r , \\r , \\'Rose, my dear!\\' said the elder lady.\\r , \\r , Rose made no reply, but played a little quicker, as though the words\\r , had roused her from some painful thoughts.\\r , \\r , \\'Rose, my love!\\' cried Mrs. Maylie, rising hastily, and bending over\\r , her.  \\'What is this?  In tears!  My dear child, what distresses you?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing, aunt; nothing,\\' replied the young lady.  \\'I don\\'t know what\\r , it is; I can\\'t describe it; but I feel--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not ill, my love?\\' interposed Mrs. Maylie.\\r , \\r , \\'No, no!  Oh, not ill!\\' replied Rose: shuddering as though some deadly\\r , chillness were passing over her, while she spoke; \\'I shall be better\\r , presently.  Close the window, pray!\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver hastened to comply with her request.  The young lady, making an\\r , effort to recover her cheerfulness, strove to play some livelier tune;\\r , but her fingers dropped powerless over the keys. Covering her face with\\r , her hands, she sank upon a sofa, and gave vent to the tears which she\\r , was now unable to repress.\\r , \\r , \\'My child!\\' said the elderly lady, folding her arms about her, \\'I never\\r , saw you so before.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I would not alarm you if I could avoid it,\\' rejoined Rose; \\'but indeed\\r , I have tried very hard, and cannot help this. I fear I _am_ ill, aunt.\\'\\r , \\r , She was, indeed; for, when candles were brought, they saw that in the\\r , very short time which had elapsed since their return home, the hue of\\r , her countenance had changed to a marble whiteness. Its expression had\\r , lost nothing of its beauty; but it was changed; and there was an\\r , anxious haggard look about the gentle face, which it had never worn\\r , before.  Another minute, and it was suffused with a crimson flush:  and\\r , a heavy wildness came over the soft blue eye.  Again this disappeared,\\r , like the shadow thrown by a passing cloud; and she was once more deadly\\r , pale.\\r , \\r , Oliver, who watched the old lady anxiously, observed that she was\\r , alarmed by these appearances; and so in truth, was he; but seeing that\\r , she affected to make light of them, he endeavoured to do the same, and\\r , they so far succeeded, that when Rose was persuaded by her aunt to\\r , retire for the night, she was in better spirits; and appeared even in\\r , better health:  assuring them that she felt certain she should rise in\\r , the morning, quite well.\\r , \\r , \\'I hope,\\' said Oliver, when Mrs. Maylie returned, \\'that nothing is the\\r , matter?  She don\\'t look well to-night, but--\\'\\r , \\r , The old lady motioned to him not to speak; and sitting herself down in\\r , a dark corner of the room, remained silent for some time. At length,\\r , she said, in a trembling voice:\\r , \\r , \\'I hope not, Oliver.  I have been very happy with her for some years:\\r , too happy, perhaps.  It may be time that I should meet with some\\r , misfortune; but I hope it is not this.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What?\\' inquired Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'The heavy blow,\\' said the old lady, \\'of losing the dear girl who has\\r , so long been my comfort and happiness.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh!  God forbid!\\' exclaimed Oliver, hastily.\\r , \\r , \\'Amen to that, my child!\\' said the old lady, wringing her hands.\\r , \\r , \\'Surely there is no danger of anything so dreadful?\\' said Oliver. \\'Two\\r , hours ago, she was quite well.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'She is very ill now,\\' rejoined Mrs. Maylies; \\'and will be worse, I am\\r , sure.  My dear, dear Rose!  Oh, what shall I do without her!\\'\\r , \\r , She gave way to such great grief, that Oliver, suppressing his own\\r , emotion, ventured to remonstrate with her; and to beg, earnestly, that,\\r , for the sake of the dear young lady herself, she would be more calm.\\r , \\r , \\'And consider, ma\\'am,\\' said Oliver, as the tears forced themselves into\\r , his eyes, despite of his efforts to the contrary. \\'Oh! consider how\\r , young and good she is, and what pleasure and comfort she gives to all\\r , about her.  I am sure--certain--quite certain--that, for your sake, who\\r , are so good yourself; and for her own; and for the sake of all she\\r , makes so happy; she will not die.  Heaven will never let her die so\\r , young.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hush!\\' said Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand on Oliver\\'s head. \\'You think\\r , like a child, poor boy.  But you teach me my duty, notwithstanding.  I\\r , had forgotten it for a moment, Oliver, but I hope I may be pardoned,\\r , for I am old, and have seen enough of illness and death to know the\\r , agony of separation from the objects of our love.  I have seen enough,\\r , too, to know that it is not always the youngest and best who are spared\\r , to those that love them; but this should give us comfort in our sorrow;\\r , for Heaven is just; and such things teach us, impressively, that there\\r , is a brighter world than this; and that the passage to it is speedy.\\r , God\\'s will be done!  I love her; and He knows how well!\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver was surprised to see that as Mrs. Maylie said these words, she\\r , checked her lamentations as though by one effort; and drawing herself\\r , up as she spoke, became composed and firm.  He was still more\\r , astonished to find that this firmness lasted; and that, under all the\\r , care and watching which ensued, Mrs. Maylie was ever ready and\\r , collected: performing all the duties which had devolved upon her,\\r , steadily, and, to all external appearances, even cheerfully.  But he\\r , was young, and did not know what strong minds are capable of, under\\r , trying circumstances.  How should he, when their possessors so seldom\\r , know themselves?\\r , \\r , An anxious night ensued.  When morning came, Mrs. Maylie\\'s predictions\\r , were but too well verified.  Rose was in the first stage of a high and\\r , dangerous fever.\\r , \\r , \\'We must be active, Oliver, and not give way to useless grief,\\' said\\r , Mrs. Maylie, laying her finger on her lip, as she looked steadily into\\r , his face; \\'this letter must be sent, with all possible expedition, to\\r , Mr. Losberne.  It must be carried to the market-town: which is not more\\r , than four miles off, by the footpath across the field:  and thence\\r , dispatched, by an express on horseback, straight to Chertsey. The\\r , people at the inn will undertake to do this: and I can trust to you to\\r , see it done, I know.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver could make no reply, but looked his anxiety to be gone at once.\\r , \\r , \\'Here is another letter,\\' said Mrs. Maylie, pausing to reflect; \\'but\\r , whether to send it now, or wait until I see how Rose goes on, I\\r , scarcely know.  I would not forward it, unless I feared the worst.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Is it for Chertsey, too, ma\\'am?\\' inquired Oliver; impatient to execute\\r , his commission, and holding out his trembling hand for the letter.\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' replied the old lady, giving it to him mechanically. Oliver\\r , glanced at it, and saw that it was directed to Harry Maylie, Esquire,\\r , at some great lord\\'s house in the country; where, he could not make out.\\r , \\r , \\'Shall it go, ma\\'am?\\' asked Oliver, looking up, impatiently.\\r , \\r , \\'I think not,\\' replied Mrs. Maylie, taking it back.  \\'I will wait until\\r , to-morrow.\\'\\r , \\r , With these words, she gave Oliver her purse, and he started off,\\r , without more delay, at the greatest speed he could muster.\\r , \\r , Swiftly he ran across the fields, and down the little lanes which\\r , sometimes divided them: now almost hidden by the high corn on either\\r , side, and now emerging on an open field, where the mowers and haymakers\\r , were busy at their work:  nor did he stop once, save now and then, for\\r , a few seconds, to recover breath, until he came, in a great heat, and\\r , covered with dust, on the little market-place of the market-town.\\r , \\r , Here he paused, and looked about for the inn.  There were a white bank,\\r , and a red brewery, and a yellow town-hall; and in one corner there was\\r , a large house, with all the wood about it painted green:  before which\\r , was the sign of \\'The George.\\'  To this he hastened, as soon as it\\r , caught his eye.\\r , \\r , He spoke to a postboy who was dozing under the gateway; and who, after\\r , hearing what he wanted, referred him to the ostler; who after hearing\\r , all he had to say again, referred him to the landlord; who was a tall\\r , gentleman in a blue neckcloth, a white hat, drab breeches, and boots\\r , with tops to match, leaning against a pump by the stable-door, picking\\r , his teeth with a silver toothpick.\\r , \\r , This gentleman walked with much deliberation into the bar to make out\\r , the bill:  which took a long time making out:  and after it was ready,\\r , and paid, a horse had to be saddled, and a man to be dressed, which\\r , took up ten good minutes more.  Meanwhile Oliver was in such a\\r , desperate state of impatience and anxiety, that he felt as if he could\\r , have jumped upon the horse himself, and galloped away, full tear, to\\r , the next stage.  At length, all was ready; and the little parcel having\\r , been handed up, with many injunctions and entreaties for its speedy\\r , delivery, the man set spurs to his horse, and rattling over the uneven\\r , paving of the market-place, was out of the town, and galloping along\\r , the turnpike-road, in a couple of minutes.\\r , \\r , As it was something to feel certain that assistance was sent for, and\\r , that no time had been lost, Oliver hurried up the inn-yard, with a\\r , somewhat lighter heart.  He was turning out of the gateway when he\\r , accidently stumbled against a tall man wrapped in a cloak, who was at\\r , that moment coming out of the inn door.\\r , \\r , \\'Hah!\\' cried the man, fixing his eyes on Oliver, and suddenly\\r , recoiling.  \\'What the devil\\'s this?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I beg your pardon, sir,\\' said Oliver; \\'I was in a great hurry to get\\r , home, and didn\\'t see you were coming.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Death!\\' muttered the man to himself, glaring at the boy with his large\\r , dark eyes.  \\'Who would have thought it! Grind him to ashes! He\\'d start\\r , up from a stone coffin, to come in my way!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I am sorry,\\' stammered Oliver, confused by the strange man\\'s wild\\r , look.  \\'I hope I have not hurt you!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Rot you!\\' murmured the man, in a horrible passion; between his\\r , clenched teeth; \\'if I had only had the courage to say the word, I might\\r , have been free of you in a night.  Curses on your head, and black death\\r , on your heart, you imp!  What are you doing here?\\'\\r , \\r , The man shook his fist, as he uttered these words incoherently. He\\r , advanced towards Oliver, as if with the intention of aiming a blow at\\r , him, but fell violently on the ground:  writhing and foaming, in a fit.\\r , \\r , Oliver gazed, for a moment, at the struggles of the madman (for such he\\r , supposed him to be); and then darted into the house for help.  Having\\r , seen him safely carried into the hotel, he turned his face homewards,\\r , running as fast as he could, to make up for lost time:  and recalling\\r , with a great deal of astonishment and some fear, the extraordinary\\r , behaviour of the person from whom he had just parted.\\r , \\r , The circumstance did not dwell in his recollection long, however: for\\r , when he reached the cottage, there was enough to occupy his mind, and\\r , to drive all considerations of self completely from his memory.\\r , \\r , Rose Maylie had rapidly grown worse; before mid-night she was\\r , delirious.  A medical practitioner, who resided on the spot, was in\\r , constant attendance upon her; and after first seeing the patient, he\\r , had taken Mrs. Maylie aside, and pronounced her disorder to be one of a\\r , most alarming nature. \\'In fact,\\' he said, \\'it would be little short of\\r , a miracle, if she recovered.\\'\\r , \\r , How often did Oliver start from his bed that night, and stealing out,\\r , with noiseless footstep, to the staircase, listen for the slightest\\r , sound from the sick chamber!  How often did a tremble shake his frame,\\r , and cold drops of terror start upon his brow, when a sudden trampling\\r , of feet caused him to fear that something too dreadful to think of, had\\r , even then occurred!  And what had been the fervency of all the prayers\\r , he had ever muttered, compared with those he poured forth, now, in the\\r , agony and passion of his supplication for the life and health of the\\r , gentle creature, who was tottering on the deep grave\\'s verge!\\r , \\r , Oh! the suspense, the fearful, acute suspense, of standing idly by\\r , while the life of one we dearly love, is trembling in the balance!  Oh!\\r , the racking thoughts that crowd upon the mind, and make the heart beat\\r , violently, and the breath come thick, by the force of the images they\\r , conjure up before it; the desperate anxiety _to be doing something_ to\\r , relieve the pain, or lessen the danger, which we have no power to\\r , alleviate; the sinking of soul and spirit, which the sad remembrance of\\r , our helplessness produces; what tortures can equal these; what\\r , reflections or endeavours can, in the full tide and fever of the time,\\r , allay them!\\r , \\r , Morning came; and the little cottage was lonely and still. People spoke\\r , in whispers; anxious faces appeared at the gate, from time to time;\\r , women and children went away in tears. All the livelong day, and for\\r , hours after it had grown dark, Oliver paced softly up and down the\\r , garden, raising his eyes every instant to the sick chamber, and\\r , shuddering to see the darkened window, looking as if death lay\\r , stretched inside.  Late that night, Mr. Losberne arrived.  \\'It is\\r , hard,\\' said the good doctor, turning away as he spoke; \\'so young; so\\r , much beloved; but there is very little hope.\\'\\r , \\r , Another morning.  The sun shone brightly; as brightly as if it looked\\r , upon no misery or care; and, with every leaf and flower in full bloom\\r , about her; with life, and health, and sounds and sights of joy,\\r , surrounding her on every side: the fair young creature lay, wasting\\r , fast.  Oliver crept away to the old churchyard, and sitting down on one\\r , of the green mounds, wept and prayed for her, in silence.\\r , \\r , There was such peace and beauty in the scene; so much of brightness and\\r , mirth in the sunny landscape; such blithesome music in the songs of the\\r , summer birds; such freedom in the rapid flight of the rook, careering\\r , overhead; so much of life and joyousness in all; that, when the boy\\r , raised his aching eyes, and looked about, the thought instinctively\\r , occurred to him, that this was not a time for death; that Rose could\\r , surely never die when humbler things were all so glad and gay; that\\r , graves were for cold and cheerless winter:  not for sunlight and\\r , fragrance. He almost thought that shrouds were for the old and\\r , shrunken; and that they never wrapped the young and graceful form in\\r , their ghastly folds.\\r , \\r , A knell from the church bell broke harshly on these youthful thoughts.\\r , Another!  Again!  It was tolling for the funeral service.  A group of\\r , humble mourners entered the gate: wearing white favours; for the corpse\\r , was young.  They stood uncovered by a grave; and there was a mother--a\\r , mother once--among the weeping train.  But the sun shone brightly, and\\r , the birds sang on.\\r , \\r , Oliver turned homeward, thinking on the many kindnesses he had received\\r , from the young lady, and wishing that the time could come again, that\\r , he might never cease showing her how grateful and attached he was.  He\\r , had no cause for self-reproach on the score of neglect, or want of\\r , thought, for he had been devoted to her service; and yet a hundred\\r , little occasions rose up before him, on which he fancied he might have\\r , been more zealous, and more earnest, and wished he had been.  We need\\r , be careful how we deal with those about us, when every death carries to\\r , some small circle of survivors, thoughts of so much omitted, and so\\r , little done--of so many things forgotten, and so many more which might\\r , have been repaired!  There is no remorse so deep as that which is\\r , unavailing; if we would be spared its tortures, let us remember this,\\r , in time.\\r , \\r , When he reached home Mrs. Maylie was sitting in the little parlour.\\r , Oliver\\'s heart sank at sight of her; for she had never left the bedside\\r , of her niece; and he trembled to think what change could have driven\\r , her away.  He learnt that she had fallen into a deep sleep, from which\\r , she would waken, either to recovery and life, or to bid them farewell,\\r , and die.\\r , \\r , They sat, listening, and afraid to speak, for hours.  The untasted meal\\r , was removed, with looks which showed that their thoughts were\\r , elsewhere, they watched the sun as he sank lower and lower, and, at\\r , length, cast over sky and earth those brilliant hues which herald his\\r , departure.  Their quick ears caught the sound of an approaching\\r , footstep.  They both involuntarily darted to the door, as Mr. Losberne\\r , entered.\\r , \\r , \\'What of Rose?\\' cried the old lady.  \\'Tell me at once!  I can bear it;\\r , anything but suspense!  Oh, tell me! in the name of Heaven!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You must compose yourself,\\' said the doctor supporting her. \\'Be calm,\\r , my dear ma\\'am, pray.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Let me go, in God\\'s name!  My dear child!  She is dead! She is dying!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No!\\' cried the doctor, passionately.  \\'As He is good and merciful, she\\r , will live to bless us all, for years to come.\\'\\r , \\r , The lady fell upon her knees, and tried to fold her hands together; but\\r , the energy which had supported her so long, fled up to Heaven with her\\r , first thanksgiving; and she sank into the friendly arms which were\\r , extended to receive her.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXXIV\\r , \\r , CONTAINS SOME INTRODUCTORY PARTICULARS RELATIVE TO A YOUNG GENTLEMAN\\r , WHO NOW ARRIVES UPON THE SCENE; AND A NEW ADVENTURE WHICH HAPPENED TO\\r , OLIVER\\r , \\r , It was almost too much happiness to bear.  Oliver felt stunned and\\r , stupefied by the unexpected intelligence; he could not weep, or speak,\\r , or rest.  He had scarcely the power of understanding anything that had\\r , passed, until, after a long ramble in the quiet evening air, a burst of\\r , tears came to his relief, and he seemed to awaken, all at once, to a\\r , full sense of the joyful change that had occurred, and the almost\\r , insupportable load of anguish which had been taken from his breast.\\r , \\r , The night was fast closing in, when he returned homeward:  laden with\\r , flowers which he had culled, with peculiar care, for the adornment of\\r , the sick chamber.  As he walked briskly along the road, he heard behind\\r , him, the noise of some vehicle, approaching at a furious pace.  Looking\\r , round, he saw that it was a post-chaise, driven at great speed; and as\\r , the horses were galloping, and the road was narrow, he stood leaning\\r , against a gate until it should have passed him.\\r , \\r , As it dashed on, Oliver caught a glimpse of a man in a white nightcap,\\r , whose face seemed familiar to him, although his view was so brief that\\r , he could not identify the person.  In another second or two, the\\r , nightcap was thrust out of the chaise-window, and a stentorian voice\\r , bellowed to the driver to stop:  which he did, as soon as he could pull\\r , up his horses.  Then, the nightcap once again appeared: and the same\\r , voice called Oliver by his name.\\r , \\r , \\'Here!\\' cried the voice.  \\'Oliver, what\\'s the news?  Miss Rose! Master\\r , O-li-ver!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Is it you, Giles?\\' cried Oliver, running up to the chaise-door.\\r , \\r , Giles popped out his nightcap again, preparatory to making some reply,\\r , when he was suddenly pulled back by a young gentleman who occupied the\\r , other corner of the chaise, and who eagerly demanded what was the news.\\r , \\r , \\'In a word!\\' cried the gentleman, \\'Better or worse?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Better--much better!\\' replied Oliver, hastily.\\r , \\r , \\'Thank Heaven!\\' exclaimed the gentleman.  \\'You are sure?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Quite, sir,\\' replied Oliver.  \\'The change took place only a few hours\\r , ago; and Mr. Losberne says, that all danger is at an end.\\'\\r , \\r , The gentleman said not another word, but, opening the chaise-door,\\r , leaped out, and taking Oliver hurriedly by the arm, led him aside.\\r , \\r , \\'You are quite certain?  There is no possibility of any mistake on your\\r , part, my boy, is there?\\' demanded the gentleman in a tremulous voice.\\r , \\'Do not deceive me, by awakening hopes that are not to be fulfilled.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I would not for the world, sir,\\' replied Oliver.  \\'Indeed you may\\r , believe me.  Mr. Losberne\\'s words were, that she would live to bless us\\r , all for many years to come.  I heard him say so.\\'\\r , \\r , The tears stood in Oliver\\'s eyes as he recalled the scene which was the\\r , beginning of so much happiness; and the gentleman turned his face away,\\r , and remained silent, for some minutes.  Oliver thought he heard him\\r , sob, more than once; but he feared to interrupt him by any fresh\\r , remark--for he could well guess what his feelings were--and so stood\\r , apart, feigning to be occupied with his nosegay.\\r , \\r , All this time, Mr. Giles, with the white nightcap on, had been sitting\\r , on the steps of the chaise, supporting an elbow on each knee, and\\r , wiping his eyes with a blue cotton pocket-handkerchief dotted with\\r , white spots.  That the honest fellow had not been feigning emotion, was\\r , abundantly demonstrated by the very red eyes with which he regarded the\\r , young gentleman, when he turned round and addressed him.\\r , \\r , \\'I think you had better go on to my mother\\'s in the chaise, Giles,\\'\\r , said he.  \\'I would rather walk slowly on, so as to gain a little time\\r , before I see her.  You can say I am coming.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I beg your pardon, Mr. Harry,\\' said Giles:  giving a final polish to\\r , his ruffled countenance with the handkerchief; \\'but if you would leave\\r , the postboy to say that, I should be very much obliged to you.  It\\r , wouldn\\'t be proper for the maids to see me in this state, sir; I should\\r , never have any more authority with them if they did.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well,\\' rejoined Harry Maylie, smiling, \\'you can do as you like. Let\\r , him go on with the luggage, if you wish it, and do you follow with us.\\r , Only first exchange that nightcap for some more appropriate covering,\\r , or we shall be taken for madmen.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Giles, reminded of his unbecoming costume, snatched off and\\r , pocketed his nightcap; and substituted a hat, of grave and sober shape,\\r , which he took out of the chaise.  This done, the postboy drove off;\\r , Giles, Mr. Maylie, and Oliver, followed at their leisure.\\r , \\r , As they walked along, Oliver glanced from time to time with much\\r , interest and curiosity at the new comer.  He seemed about\\r , five-and-twenty years of age, and was of the middle height; his\\r , countenance was frank and handsome; and his demeanor easy and\\r , prepossessing.  Notwithstanding the difference between youth and age,\\r , he bore so strong a likeness to the old lady, that Oliver would have\\r , had no great difficulty in imagining their relationship, if he had not\\r , already spoken of her as his mother.\\r , \\r , Mrs. Maylie was anxiously waiting to receive her son when he reached\\r , the cottage.  The meeting did not take place without great emotion on\\r , both sides.\\r , \\r , \\'Mother!\\' whispered the young man; \\'why did you not write before?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I did,\\' replied Mrs. Maylie; \\'but, on reflection, I determined to keep\\r , back the letter until I had heard Mr. Losberne\\'s opinion.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'But why,\\' said the young man, \\'why run the chance of that occurring\\r , which so nearly happened?  If Rose had--I cannot utter that word\\r , now--if this illness had terminated differently, how could you ever\\r , have forgiven yourself!  How could I ever have know happiness again!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If that _had_ been the case, Harry,\\' said Mrs. Maylie, \\'I fear your\\r , happiness would have been effectually blighted, and that your arrival\\r , here, a day sooner or a day later, would have been of very, very little\\r , import.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And who can wonder if it be so, mother?\\' rejoined the young man; \\'or\\r , why should I say, _if_?--It is--it is--you know it, mother--you must\\r , know it!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I know that she deserves the best and purest love the heart of man can\\r , offer,\\' said Mrs. Maylie; \\'I know that the devotion and affection of\\r , her nature require no ordinary return, but one that shall be deep and\\r , lasting.  If I did not feel this, and know, besides, that a changed\\r , behaviour in one she loved would break her heart, I should not feel my\\r , task so difficult of performance, or have to encounter so many\\r , struggles in my own bosom, when I take what seems to me to be the\\r , strict line of duty.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'This is unkind, mother,\\' said Harry.  \\'Do you still suppose that I am\\r , a boy ignorant of my own mind, and mistaking the impulses of my own\\r , soul?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I think, my dear son,\\' returned Mrs. Maylie, laying her hand upon his\\r , shoulder, \\'that youth has many generous impulses which do not last; and\\r , that among them are some, which, being gratified, become only the more\\r , fleeting.  Above all, I think\\' said the lady, fixing her eyes on her\\r , son\\'s face, \\'that if an enthusiastic, ardent, and ambitious man marry a\\r , wife on whose name there is a stain, which, though it originate in no\\r , fault of hers, may be visited by cold and sordid people upon her, and\\r , upon his children also: and, in exact proportion to his success in the\\r , world, be cast in his teeth, and made the subject of sneers against\\r , him:  he may, no matter how generous and good his nature, one day\\r , repent of the connection he formed in early life.  And she may have the\\r , pain of knowing that he does so.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Mother,\\' said the young man, impatiently, \\'he would be a selfish\\r , brute, unworthy alike of the name of man and of the woman you describe,\\r , who acted thus.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You think so now, Harry,\\' replied his mother.\\r , \\r , \\'And ever will!\\' said the young man.  \\'The mental agony I have\\r , suffered, during the last two days, wrings from me the avowal to you of\\r , a passion which, as you well know, is not one of yesterday, nor one I\\r , have lightly formed.  On Rose, sweet, gentle girl! my heart is set, as\\r , firmly as ever heart of man was set on woman.  I have no thought, no\\r , view, no hope in life, beyond her; and if you oppose me in this great\\r , stake, you take my peace and happiness in your hands, and cast them to\\r , the wind.  Mother, think better of this, and of me, and do not\\r , disregard the happiness of which you seem to think so little.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Harry,\\' said Mrs. Maylie, \\'it is because I think so much of warm and\\r , sensitive hearts, that I would spare them from being wounded. But we\\r , have said enough, and more than enough, on this matter, just now.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Let it rest with Rose, then,\\' interposed Harry.  \\'You will not press\\r , these overstrained opinions of yours, so far, as to throw any obstacle\\r , in my way?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I will not,\\' rejoined Mrs. Maylie; \\'but I would have you consider--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I _have_ considered!\\' was the impatient reply; \\'Mother, I have\\r , considered, years and years.  I have considered, ever since I have been\\r , capable of serious reflection.  My feelings remain unchanged, as they\\r , ever will; and why should I suffer the pain of a delay in giving them\\r , vent, which can be productive of no earthly good?  No!  Before I leave\\r , this place, Rose shall hear me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'She shall,\\' said Mrs. Maylie.\\r , \\r , \\'There is something in your manner, which would almost imply that she\\r , will hear me coldly, mother,\\' said the young man.\\r , \\r , \\'Not coldly,\\' rejoined the old lady; \\'far from it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'How then?\\' urged the young man.  \\'She has formed no other attachment?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, indeed,\\' replied his mother; \\'you have, or I mistake, too strong a\\r , hold on her affections already.  What I would say,\\' resumed the old\\r , lady, stopping her son as he was about to speak, \\'is this.  Before you\\r , stake your all on this chance; before you suffer yourself to be carried\\r , to the highest point of hope; reflect for a few moments, my dear child,\\r , on Rose\\'s history, and consider what effect the knowledge of her\\r , doubtful birth may have on her decision:  devoted as she is to us, with\\r , all the intensity of her noble mind, and with that perfect sacrifice of\\r , self which, in all matters, great or trifling, has always been her\\r , characteristic.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What do you mean?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That I leave you to discover,\\' replied Mrs. Maylie.  \\'I must go back\\r , to her.  God bless you!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I shall see you again to-night?\\' said the young man, eagerly.\\r , \\r , \\'By and by,\\' replied the lady; \\'when I leave Rose.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You will tell her I am here?\\' said Harry.\\r , \\r , \\'Of course,\\' replied Mrs. Maylie.\\r , \\r , \\'And say how anxious I have been, and how much I have suffered, and how\\r , I long to see her.  You will not refuse to do this, mother?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' said the old lady; \\'I will tell her all.\\'  And pressing her son\\'s\\r , hand, affectionately, she hastened from the room.\\r , \\r , Mr. Losberne and Oliver had remained at another end of the apartment\\r , while this hurried conversation was proceeding.  The former now held\\r , out his hand to Harry Maylie; and hearty salutations were exchanged\\r , between them.  The doctor then communicated, in reply to multifarious\\r , questions from his young friend, a precise account of his patient\\'s\\r , situation; which was quite as consolatory and full of promise, as\\r , Oliver\\'s statement had encouraged him to hope; and to the whole of\\r , which, Mr. Giles, who affected to be busy about the luggage, listened\\r , with greedy ears.\\r , \\r , \\'Have you shot anything particular, lately, Giles?\\' inquired the\\r , doctor, when he had concluded.\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing particular, sir,\\' replied Mr. Giles, colouring up to the eyes.\\r , \\r , \\'Nor catching any thieves, nor identifying any house-breakers?\\' said\\r , the doctor.\\r , \\r , \\'None at all, sir,\\' replied Mr. Giles, with much gravity.\\r , \\r , \\'Well,\\' said the doctor, \\'I am sorry to hear it, because you do that\\r , sort of thing admirably.  Pray, how is Brittles?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The boy is very well, sir,\\' said Mr. Giles, recovering his usual tone\\r , of patronage; \\'and sends his respectful duty, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s well,\\' said the doctor.  \\'Seeing you here, reminds me, Mr.\\r , Giles, that on the day before that on which I was called away so\\r , hurriedly, I executed, at the request of your good mistress, a small\\r , commission in your favour.  Just step into this corner a moment, will\\r , you?\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Giles walked into the corner with much importance, and some wonder,\\r , and was honoured with a short whispering conference with the doctor, on\\r , the termination of which, he made a great many bows, and retired with\\r , steps of unusual stateliness.  The subject matter of this conference\\r , was not disclosed in the parlour, but the kitchen was speedily\\r , enlightened concerning it; for Mr. Giles walked straight thither, and\\r , having called for a mug of ale, announced, with an air of majesty,\\r , which was highly effective, that it had pleased his mistress, in\\r , consideration of his gallant behaviour on the occasion of that\\r , attempted robbery, to deposit, in the local savings-bank, the sum of\\r , five-and-twenty pounds, for his sole use and benefit.  At this, the two\\r , women-servants lifted up their hands and eyes, and supposed that Mr.\\r , Giles, pulling out his shirt-frill, replied, \\'No, no\\'; and that if they\\r , observed that he was at all haughty to his inferiors, he would thank\\r , them to tell him so.  And then he made a great many other remarks, no\\r , less illustrative of his humility, which were received with equal\\r , favour and applause, and were, withal, as original and as much to the\\r , purpose, as the remarks of great men commonly are.\\r , \\r , Above stairs, the remainder of the evening passed cheerfully away; for\\r , the doctor was in high spirits; and however fatigued or thoughtful\\r , Harry Maylie might have been at first, he was not proof against the\\r , worthy gentleman\\'s good humour, which displayed itself in a great\\r , variety of sallies and professional recollections, and an abundance of\\r , small jokes, which struck Oliver as being the drollest things he had\\r , ever heard, and caused him to laugh proportionately; to the evident\\r , satisfaction of the doctor, who laughed immoderately at himself, and\\r , made Harry laugh almost as heartily, by the very force of sympathy.\\r , So, they were as pleasant a party as, under the circumstances, they\\r , could well have been; and it was late before they retired, with light\\r , and thankful hearts, to take that rest of which, after the doubt and\\r , suspense they had recently undergone, they stood much in need.\\r , \\r , Oliver rose next morning, in better heart, and went about his usual\\r , occupations, with more hope and pleasure than he had known for many\\r , days.  The birds were once more hung out, to sing, in their old places;\\r , and the sweetest wild flowers that could be found, were once more\\r , gathered to gladden Rose with their beauty. The melancholy which had\\r , seemed to the sad eyes of the anxious boy to hang, for days past, over\\r , every object, beautiful as all were, was dispelled by magic.  The dew\\r , seemed to sparkle more brightly on the green leaves; the air to rustle\\r , among them with a sweeter music; and the sky itself to look more blue\\r , and bright. Such is the influence which the condition of our own\\r , thoughts, exercise, even over the appearance of external objects.  Men\\r , who look on nature, and their fellow-men, and cry that all is dark and\\r , gloomy, are in the right; but the sombre colours are reflections from\\r , their own jaundiced eyes and hearts.  The real hues are delicate, and\\r , need a clearer vision.\\r , \\r , It is worthy of remark, and Oliver did not fail to note it at the time,\\r , that his morning expeditions were no longer made alone. Harry Maylie,\\r , after the very first morning when he met Oliver coming laden home, was\\r , seized with such a passion for flowers, and displayed such a taste in\\r , their arrangement, as left his young companion far behind.  If Oliver\\r , were behindhand in these respects, he knew where the best were to be\\r , found; and morning after morning they scoured the country together, and\\r , brought home the fairest that blossomed.  The window of the young\\r , lady\\'s chamber was opened now; for she loved to feel the rich summer\\r , air stream in, and revive her with its freshness; but there always\\r , stood in water, just inside the lattice, one particular little bunch,\\r , which was made up with great care, every morning.  Oliver could not\\r , help noticing that the withered flowers were never thrown away,\\r , although the little vase was regularly replenished; nor, could he help\\r , observing, that whenever the doctor came into the garden, he invariably\\r , cast his eyes up to that particular corner, and nodded his head most\\r , expressively, as he set forth on his morning\\'s walk.  Pending these\\r , observations, the days were flying by; and Rose was rapidly recovering.\\r , \\r , Nor did Oliver\\'s time hang heavy on his hands, although the young lady\\r , had not yet left her chamber, and there were no evening walks, save now\\r , and then, for a short distance, with Mrs. Maylie. He applied himself,\\r , with redoubled assiduity, to the instructions of the white-headed old\\r , gentleman, and laboured so hard that his quick progress surprised even\\r , himself.  It was while he was engaged in this pursuit, that he was\\r , greatly startled and distressed by a most unexpected occurrence.\\r , \\r , The little room in which he was accustomed to sit, when busy at his\\r , books, was on the ground-floor, at the back of the house.  It was quite\\r , a cottage-room, with a lattice-window: around which were clusters of\\r , jessamine and honeysuckle, that crept over the casement, and filled the\\r , place with their delicious perfume.  It looked into a garden, whence a\\r , wicket-gate opened into a small paddock; all beyond, was fine\\r , meadow-land and wood.  There was no other dwelling near, in that\\r , direction; and the prospect it commanded was very extensive.\\r , \\r , One beautiful evening, when the first shades of twilight were beginning\\r , to settle upon the earth, Oliver sat at this window, intent upon his\\r , books.  He had been poring over them for some time; and, as the day had\\r , been uncommonly sultry, and he had exerted himself a great deal, it is\\r , no disparagement to the authors, whoever they may have been, to say,\\r , that gradually and by slow degrees, he fell asleep.\\r , \\r , There is a kind of sleep that steals upon us sometimes, which, while it\\r , holds the body prisoner, does not free the mind from a sense of things\\r , about it, and enable it to ramble at its pleasure.  So far as an\\r , overpowering heaviness, a prostration of strength, and an utter\\r , inability to control our thoughts or power of motion, can be called\\r , sleep, this is it; and yet, we have a consciousness of all that is\\r , going on about us, and, if we dream at such a time, words which are\\r , really spoken, or sounds which really exist at the moment, accommodate\\r , themselves with surprising readiness to our visions, until reality and\\r , imagination become so strangely blended that it is afterwards almost\\r , matter of impossibility to separate the two.  Nor is this, the most\\r , striking phenomenon incidental to such a state.  It is an undoubted\\r , fact, that although our senses of touch and sight be for the time dead,\\r , yet our sleeping thoughts, and the visionary scenes that pass before\\r , us, will be influenced and materially influenced, by the _mere silent\\r , presence_ of some external object; which may not have been near us when\\r , we closed our eyes:  and of whose vicinity we have had no waking\\r , consciousness.\\r , \\r , Oliver knew, perfectly well, that he was in his own little room; that\\r , his books were lying on the table before him; that the sweet air was\\r , stirring among the creeping plants outside.  And yet he was asleep.\\r , Suddenly, the scene changed; the air became close and confined; and he\\r , thought, with a glow of terror, that he was in the Jew\\'s house again.\\r , There sat the hideous old man, in his accustomed corner, pointing at\\r , him, and whispering to another man, with his face averted, who sat\\r , beside him.\\r , \\r , \\'Hush, my dear!\\' he thought he heard the Jew say; \\'it is he, sure\\r , enough.  Come away.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He!\\' the other man seemed to answer; \\'could I mistake him, think you?\\r , If a crowd of ghosts were to put themselves into his exact shape, and\\r , he stood amongst them, there is something that would tell me how to\\r , point him out.  If you buried him fifty feet deep, and took me across\\r , his grave, I fancy I should know, if there wasn\\'t a mark above it, that\\r , he lay buried there?\\'\\r , \\r , The man seemed to say this, with such dreadful hatred, that Oliver\\r , awoke with the fear, and started up.\\r , \\r , Good Heaven!  what was that, which sent the blood tingling to his\\r , heart, and deprived him of his voice, and of power to move!\\r , There--there--at the window--close before him--so close, that he could\\r , have almost touched him before he started back:  with his eyes peering\\r , into the room, and meeting his:  there stood the Jew!  And beside him,\\r , white with rage or fear, or both, were the scowling features of the man\\r , who had accosted him in the inn-yard.\\r , \\r , It was but an instant, a glance, a flash, before his eyes; and they\\r , were gone.  But they had recognised him, and he them; and their look\\r , was as firmly impressed upon his memory, as if it had been deeply\\r , carved in stone, and set before him from his birth. He stood transfixed\\r , for a moment; then, leaping from the window into the garden, called\\r , loudly for help.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXXV\\r , \\r , CONTAINING THE UNSATISFACTORY RESULT OF OLIVER\\'S ADVENTURE; AND A\\r , CONVERSATION OF SOME IMPORTANCE BETWEEN HARRY MAYLIE AND ROSE\\r , \\r , When the inmates of the house, attracted by Oliver\\'s cries, hurried to\\r , the spot from which they proceeded, they found him, pale and agitated,\\r , pointing in the direction of the meadows behind the house, and scarcely\\r , able to articulate the words, \\'The Jew! the Jew!\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Giles was at a loss to comprehend what this outcry meant; but Harry\\r , Maylie, whose perceptions were something quicker, and who had heard\\r , Oliver\\'s history from his mother, understood it at once.\\r , \\r , \\'What direction did he take?\\' he asked, catching up a heavy stick which\\r , was standing in a corner.\\r , \\r , \\'That,\\' replied Oliver, pointing out the course the man had taken; \\'I\\r , missed them in an instant.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then, they are in the ditch!\\' said Harry.  \\'Follow!  And keep as near\\r , me, as you can.\\' So saying, he sprang over the hedge, and darted off\\r , with a speed which rendered it matter of exceeding difficulty for the\\r , others to keep near him.\\r , \\r , Giles followed as well as he could; and Oliver followed too; and in the\\r , course of a minute or two, Mr. Losberne, who had been out walking, and\\r , just then returned, tumbled over the hedge after them, and picking\\r , himself up with more agility than he could have been supposed to\\r , possess, struck into the same course at no contemptible speed, shouting\\r , all the while, most prodigiously, to know what was the matter.\\r , \\r , On they all went; nor stopped they once to breathe, until the leader,\\r , striking off into an angle of the field indicated by Oliver, began to\\r , search, narrowly, the ditch and hedge adjoining; which afforded time\\r , for the remainder of the party to come up; and for Oliver to\\r , communicate to Mr. Losberne the circumstances that had led to so\\r , vigorous a pursuit.\\r , \\r , The search was all in vain.  There were not even the traces of recent\\r , footsteps, to be seen.  They stood now, on the summit of a little hill,\\r , commanding the open fields in every direction for three or four miles.\\r , There was the village in the hollow on the left; but, in order to gain\\r , that, after pursuing the track Oliver had pointed out, the men must\\r , have made a circuit of open ground, which it was impossible they could\\r , have accomplished in so short a time.  A thick wood skirted the\\r , meadow-land in another direction; but they could not have gained that\\r , covert for the same reason.\\r , \\r , \\'It must have been a dream, Oliver,\\' said Harry Maylie.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh no, indeed, sir,\\' replied Oliver, shuddering at the very\\r , recollection of the old wretch\\'s countenance; \\'I saw him too plainly\\r , for that.  I saw them both, as plainly as I see you now.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Who was the other?\\' inquired Harry and Mr. Losberne, together.\\r , \\r , \\'The very same man I told you of, who came so suddenly upon me at the\\r , inn,\\' said Oliver.  \\'We had our eyes fixed full upon each other; and I\\r , could swear to him.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'They took this way?\\' demanded Harry:  \\'are you sure?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'As I am that the men were at the window,\\' replied Oliver, pointing\\r , down, as he spoke, to the hedge which divided the cottage-garden from\\r , the meadow.  \\'The tall man leaped over, just there; and the Jew,\\r , running a few paces to the right, crept through that gap.\\'\\r , \\r , The two gentlemen watched Oliver\\'s earnest face, as he spoke, and\\r , looking from him to each other, seemed to feel satisfied of the\\r , accuracy of what he said.  Still, in no direction were there any\\r , appearances of the trampling of men in hurried flight.  The grass was\\r , long; but it was trodden down nowhere, save where their own feet had\\r , crushed it.  The sides and brinks of the ditches were of damp clay; but\\r , in no one place could they discern the print of men\\'s shoes, or the\\r , slightest mark which would indicate that any feet had pressed the\\r , ground for hours before.\\r , \\r , \\'This is strange!\\' said Harry.\\r , \\r , \\'Strange?\\' echoed the doctor.  \\'Blathers and Duff, themselves, could\\r , make nothing of it.\\'\\r , \\r , Notwithstanding the evidently useless nature of their search, they did\\r , not desist until the coming on of night rendered its further\\r , prosecution hopeless; and even then, they gave it up with reluctance.\\r , Giles was dispatched to the different ale-houses in the village,\\r , furnished with the best description Oliver could give of the appearance\\r , and dress of the strangers.  Of these, the Jew was, at all events,\\r , sufficiently remarkable to be remembered, supposing he had been seen\\r , drinking, or loitering about; but Giles returned without any\\r , intelligence, calculated to dispel or lessen the mystery.\\r , \\r , On the next day, fresh search was made, and the inquiries renewed; but\\r , with no better success.  On the day following, Oliver and Mr. Maylie\\r , repaired to the market-town, in the hope of seeing or hearing something\\r , of the men there; but this effort was equally fruitless.  After a few\\r , days, the affair began to be forgotten, as most affairs are, when\\r , wonder, having no fresh food to support it, dies away of itself.\\r , \\r , Meanwhile, Rose was rapidly recovering.  She had left her room: was\\r , able to go out; and mixing once more with the family, carried joy into\\r , the hearts of all.\\r , \\r , But, although this happy change had a visible effect on the little\\r , circle; and although cheerful voices and merry laughter were once more\\r , heard in the cottage; there was at times, an unwonted restraint upon\\r , some there:  even upon Rose herself: which Oliver could not fail to\\r , remark.  Mrs. Maylie and her son were often closeted together for a\\r , long time; and more than once Rose appeared with traces of tears upon\\r , her face.  After Mr. Losberne had fixed a day for his departure to\\r , Chertsey, these symptoms increased; and it became evident that\\r , something was in progress which affected the peace of the young lady,\\r , and of somebody else besides.\\r , \\r , At length, one morning, when Rose was alone in the breakfast-parlour,\\r , Harry Maylie entered; and, with some hesitation, begged permission to\\r , speak with her for a few moments.\\r , \\r , \\'A few--a very few--will suffice, Rose,\\' said the young man, drawing\\r , his chair towards her.  \\'What I shall have to say, has already\\r , presented itself to your mind; the most cherished hopes of my heart are\\r , not unknown to you, though from my lips you have not heard them stated.\\'\\r , \\r , Rose had been very pale from the moment of his entrance; but that might\\r , have been the effect of her recent illness.  She merely bowed; and\\r , bending over some plants that stood near, waited in silence for him to\\r , proceed.\\r , \\r , \\'I--I--ought to have left here, before,\\' said Harry.\\r , \\r , \\'You should, indeed,\\' replied Rose.  \\'Forgive me for saying so, but I\\r , wish you had.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I was brought here, by the most dreadful and agonising of all\\r , apprehensions,\\' said the young man; \\'the fear of losing the one dear\\r , being on whom my every wish and hope are fixed.  You had been dying;\\r , trembling between earth and heaven.  We know that when the young, the\\r , beautiful, and good, are visited with sickness, their pure spirits\\r , insensibly turn towards their bright home of lasting rest; we know,\\r , Heaven help us! that the best and fairest of our kind, too often fade\\r , in blooming.\\'\\r , \\r , There were tears in the eyes of the gentle girl, as these words were\\r , spoken; and when one fell upon the flower over which she bent, and\\r , glistened brightly in its cup, making it more beautiful, it seemed as\\r , though the outpouring of her fresh young heart, claimed kindred\\r , naturally, with the loveliest things in nature.\\r , \\r , \\'A creature,\\' continued the young man, passionately, \\'a creature as\\r , fair and innocent of guile as one of God\\'s own angels, fluttered\\r , between life and death.  Oh! who could hope, when the distant world to\\r , which she was akin, half opened to her view, that she would return to\\r , the sorrow and calamity of this!  Rose, Rose, to know that you were\\r , passing away like some soft shadow, which a light from above, casts\\r , upon the earth; to have no hope that you would be spared to those who\\r , linger here; hardly to know a reason why you should be; to feel that\\r , you belonged to that bright sphere whither so many of the fairest and\\r , the best have winged their early flight; and yet to pray, amid all\\r , these consolations, that you might be restored to those who loved\\r , you--these were distractions almost too great to bear. They were mine,\\r , by day and night; and with them, came such a rushing torrent of fears,\\r , and apprehensions, and selfish regrets, lest you should die, and never\\r , know how devotedly I loved you, as almost bore down sense and reason in\\r , its course.  You recovered. Day by day, and almost hour by hour, some\\r , drop of health came back, and mingling with the spent and feeble stream\\r , of life which circulated languidly within you, swelled it again to a\\r , high and rushing tide.  I have watched you change almost from death, to\\r , life, with eyes that turned blind with their eagerness and deep\\r , affection. Do not tell me that you wish I had lost this; for it has\\r , softened my heart to all mankind.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I did not mean that,\\' said Rose, weeping; \\'I only wish you had left\\r , here, that you might have turned to high and noble pursuits again; to\\r , pursuits well worthy of you.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'There is no pursuit more worthy of me:  more worthy of the highest\\r , nature that exists:  than the struggle to win such a heart as yours,\\'\\r , said the young man, taking her hand. \\'Rose, my own dear Rose!  For\\r , years--for years--I have loved you; hoping to win my way to fame, and\\r , then come proudly home and tell you it had been pursued only for you to\\r , share; thinking, in my daydreams, how I would remind you, in that happy\\r , moment, of the many silent tokens I had given of a boy\\'s attachment,\\r , and claim your hand, as in redemption of some old mute contract that\\r , had been sealed between us!  That time has not arrived; but here, with\\r , not fame won, and no young vision realised, I offer you the heart so\\r , long your own, and stake my all upon the words with which you greet the\\r , offer.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Your behaviour has ever been kind and noble.\\' said Rose, mastering the\\r , emotions by which she was agitated.  \\'As you believe that I am not\\r , insensible or ungrateful, so hear my answer.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It is, that I may endeavour to deserve you; it is, dear Rose?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It is,\\' replied Rose, \\'that you must endeavour to forget me; not as\\r , your old and dearly-attached companion, for that would wound me deeply;\\r , but, as the object of your love.  Look into the world; think how many\\r , hearts you would be proud to gain, are there. Confide some other\\r , passion to me, if you will; I will be the truest, warmest, and most\\r , faithful friend you have.\\'\\r , \\r , There was a pause, during which, Rose, who had covered her face with\\r , one hand, gave free vent to her tears.  Harry still retained the other.\\r , \\r , \\'And your reasons, Rose,\\' he said, at length, in a low voice; \\'your\\r , reasons for this decision?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You have a right to know them,\\' rejoined Rose.  \\'You can say nothing\\r , to alter my resolution.  It is a duty that I must perform.  I owe it,\\r , alike to others, and to myself.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'To yourself?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, Harry.  I owe it to myself, that I, a friendless, portionless,\\r , girl, with a blight upon my name, should not give your friends reason\\r , to suspect that I had sordidly yielded to your first passion, and\\r , fastened myself, a clog, on all your hopes and projects.  I owe it to\\r , you and yours, to prevent you from opposing, in the warmth of your\\r , generous nature, this great obstacle to your progress in the world.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If your inclinations chime with your sense of duty--\\' Harry began.\\r , \\r , \\'They do not,\\' replied Rose, colouring deeply.\\r , \\r , \\'Then you return my love?\\' said Harry.  \\'Say but that, dear Rose; say\\r , but that; and soften the bitterness of this hard disappointment!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If I could have done so, without doing heavy wrong to him I loved,\\'\\r , rejoined Rose, \\'I could have--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Have received this declaration very differently?\\' said Harry. \\'Do not\\r , conceal that from me, at least, Rose.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I could,\\' said Rose.  \\'Stay!\\' she added, disengaging her hand, \\'why\\r , should we prolong this painful interview?  Most painful to me, and yet\\r , productive of lasting happiness, notwithstanding; for it _will_ be\\r , happiness to know that I once held the high place in your regard which\\r , I now occupy, and every triumph you achieve in life will animate me\\r , with new fortitude and firmness.  Farewell, Harry!  As we have met\\r , to-day, we meet no more; but in other relations than those in which\\r , this conversation have placed us, we may be long and happily entwined;\\r , and may every blessing that the prayers of a true and earnest heart can\\r , call down from the source of all truth and sincerity, cheer and prosper\\r , you!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Another word, Rose,\\' said Harry.  \\'Your reason in your own words.\\r , From your own lips, let me hear it!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The prospect before you,\\' answered Rose, firmly, \\'is a brilliant one.\\r , All the honours to which great talents and powerful connections can\\r , help men in public life, are in store for you. But those connections\\r , are proud; and I will neither mingle with such as may hold in scorn the\\r , mother who gave me life; nor bring disgrace or failure on the son of\\r , her who has so well supplied that mother\\'s place.  In a word,\\' said the\\r , young lady, turning away, as her temporary firmness forsook her, \\'there\\r , is a stain upon my name, which the world visits on innocent heads.  I\\r , will carry it into no blood but my own; and the reproach shall rest\\r , alone on me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'One word more, Rose.  Dearest Rose! one more!\\' cried Harry, throwing\\r , himself before her.  \\'If I had been less--less fortunate, the world\\r , would call it--if some obscure and peaceful life had been my\\r , destiny--if I had been poor, sick, helpless--would you have turned from\\r , me then?  Or has my probable advancement to riches and honour, given\\r , this scruple birth?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Do not press me to reply,\\' answered Rose.  \\'The question does not\\r , arise, and never will.  It is unfair, almost unkind, to urge it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If your answer be what I almost dare to hope it is,\\' retorted Harry,\\r , \\'it will shed a gleam of happiness upon my lonely way, and light the\\r , path before me.  It is not an idle thing to do so much, by the\\r , utterance of a few brief words, for one who loves you beyond all else.\\r , Oh, Rose: in the name of my ardent and enduring attachment; in the name\\r , of all I have suffered for you, and all you doom me to undergo; answer\\r , me this one question!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then, if your lot had been differently cast,\\' rejoined Rose; \\'if you\\r , had been even a little, but not so far, above me; if I could have been\\r , a help and comfort to you in any humble scene of peace and retirement,\\r , and not a blot and drawback in ambitious and distinguished crowds; I\\r , should have been spared this trial.  I have every reason to be happy,\\r , very happy, now; but then, Harry, I own I should have been happier.\\'\\r , \\r , Busy recollections of old hopes, cherished as a girl, long ago, crowded\\r , into the mind of Rose, while making this avowal; but they brought tears\\r , with them, as old hopes will when they come back withered; and they\\r , relieved her.\\r , \\r , \\'I cannot help this weakness, and it makes my purpose stronger,\\' said\\r , Rose, extending her hand.  \\'I must leave you now, indeed.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I ask one promise,\\' said Harry.  \\'Once, and only once more,--say\\r , within a year, but it may be much sooner,--I may speak to you again on\\r , this subject, for the last time.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not to press me to alter my right determination,\\' replied Rose, with a\\r , melancholy smile; \\'it will be useless.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' said Harry; \\'to hear you repeat it, if you will--finally repeat\\r , it!  I will lay at your feet, whatever of station of fortune I may\\r , possess; and if you still adhere to your present resolution, will not\\r , seek, by word or act, to change it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then let it be so,\\' rejoined Rose; \\'it is but one pang the more, and\\r , by that time I may be enabled to bear it better.\\'\\r , \\r , She extended her hand again.  But the young man caught her to his\\r , bosom; and imprinting one kiss on her beautiful forehead, hurried from\\r , the room.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXXVI\\r , \\r , IS A VERY SHORT ONE, AND MAY APPEAR OF NO GREAT IMPORTANCE IN ITS\\r , PLACE, BUT IT SHOULD BE READ NOTWITHSTANDING, AS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST,\\r , AND A KEY TO ONE THAT WILL FOLLOW WHEN ITS TIME ARRIVES\\r , \\r , \\'And so you are resolved to be my travelling companion this morning;\\r , eh?\\' said the doctor, as Harry Maylie joined him and Oliver at the\\r , breakfast-table.  \\'Why, you are not in the same mind or intention two\\r , half-hours together!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You will tell me a different tale one of these days,\\' said Harry,\\r , colouring without any perceptible reason.\\r , \\r , \\'I hope I may have good cause to do so,\\' replied Mr. Losberne; \\'though\\r , I confess I don\\'t think I shall.  But yesterday morning you had made up\\r , your mind, in a great hurry, to stay here, and to accompany your\\r , mother, like a dutiful son, to the sea-side. Before noon, you announce\\r , that you are going to do me the honour of accompanying me as far as I\\r , go, on your road to London.  And at night, you urge me, with great\\r , mystery, to start before the ladies are stirring; the consequence of\\r , which is, that young Oliver here is pinned down to his breakfast when\\r , he ought to be ranging the meadows after botanical phenomena of all\\r , kinds. Too bad, isn\\'t it, Oliver?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I should have been very sorry not to have been at home when you and\\r , Mr. Maylie went away, sir,\\' rejoined Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s a fine fellow,\\' said the doctor; \\'you shall come and see me\\r , when you return.  But, to speak seriously, Harry; has any communication\\r , from the great nobs produced this sudden anxiety on your part to be\\r , gone?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The great nobs,\\' replied Harry, \\'under which designation, I presume,\\r , you include my most stately uncle, have not communicated with me at\\r , all, since I have been here; nor, at this time of the year, is it\\r , likely that anything would occur to render necessary my immediate\\r , attendance among them.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well,\\' said the doctor, \\'you are a queer fellow.  But of course they\\r , will get you into parliament at the election before Christmas, and\\r , these sudden shiftings and changes are no bad preparation for political\\r , life.  There\\'s something in that.  Good training is always desirable,\\r , whether the race be for place, cup, or sweepstakes.\\'\\r , \\r , Harry Maylie looked as if he could have followed up this short dialogue\\r , by one or two remarks that would have staggered the doctor not a\\r , little; but he contented himself with saying, \\'We shall see,\\' and\\r , pursued the subject no farther.  The post-chaise drove up to the door\\r , shortly afterwards; and Giles coming in for the luggage, the good\\r , doctor bustled out, to see it packed.\\r , \\r , \\'Oliver,\\' said Harry Maylie, in a low voice, \\'let me speak a word with\\r , you.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver walked into the window-recess to which Mr. Maylie beckoned him;\\r , much surprised at the mixture of sadness and boisterous spirits, which\\r , his whole behaviour displayed.\\r , \\r , \\'You can write well now?\\' said Harry, laying his hand upon his arm.\\r , \\r , \\'I hope so, sir,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'I shall not be at home again, perhaps for some time; I wish you would\\r , write to me--say once a fort-night:  every alternate Monday: to the\\r , General Post Office in London.  Will you?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh! certainly, sir; I shall be proud to do it,\\' exclaimed Oliver,\\r , greatly delighted with the commission.\\r , \\r , \\'I should like to know how--how my mother and Miss Maylie are,\\' said\\r , the young man; \\'and you can fill up a sheet by telling me what walks\\r , you take, and what you talk about, and whether she--they, I mean--seem\\r , happy and quite well. You understand me?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh! quite, sir, quite,\\' replied Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'I would rather you did not mention it to them,\\' said Harry, hurrying\\r , over his words; \\'because it might make my mother anxious to write to me\\r , oftener, and it is a trouble and worry to her. Let it be a secret\\r , between you and me; and mind you tell me everything!  I depend upon\\r , you.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver, quite elated and honoured by a sense of his importance,\\r , faithfully promised to be secret and explicit in his communications.\\r , Mr. Maylie took leave of him, with many assurances of his regard and\\r , protection.\\r , \\r , The doctor was in the chaise; Giles (who, it had been arranged, should\\r , be left behind) held the door open in his hand; and the women-servants\\r , were in the garden, looking on.  Harry cast one slight glance at the\\r , latticed window, and jumped into the carriage.\\r , \\r , \\'Drive on!\\' he cried, \\'hard, fast, full gallop!  Nothing short of\\r , flying will keep pace with me, to-day.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Halloa!\\' cried the doctor, letting down the front glass in a great\\r , hurry, and shouting to the postillion; \\'something very short of flying\\r , will keep pace with _me_.  Do you hear?\\'\\r , \\r , Jingling and clattering, till distance rendered its noise inaudible,\\r , and its rapid progress only perceptible to the eye, the vehicle wound\\r , its way along the road, almost hidden in a cloud of dust: now wholly\\r , disappearing, and now becoming visible again, as intervening objects,\\r , or the intricacies of the way, permitted.  It was not until even the\\r , dusty cloud was no longer to be seen, that the gazers dispersed.\\r , \\r , And there was one looker-on, who remained with eyes fixed upon the spot\\r , where the carriage had disappeared, long after it was many miles away;\\r , for, behind the white curtain which had shrouded her from view when\\r , Harry raised his eyes towards the window, sat Rose herself.\\r , \\r , \\'He seems in high spirits and happy,\\' she said, at length. \\'I feared\\r , for a time he might be otherwise.  I was mistaken.  I am very, very\\r , glad.\\'\\r , \\r , Tears are signs of gladness as well as grief; but those which coursed\\r , down Rose\\'s face, as she sat pensively at the window, still gazing in\\r , the same direction, seemed to tell more of sorrow than of joy.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXXVII\\r , \\r , IN WHICH THE READER MAY PERCEIVE A CONTRAST, NOT UNCOMMON IN\\r , MATRIMONIAL CASES\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble sat in the workhouse parlour, with his eyes moodily fixed on\\r , the cheerless grate, whence, as it was summer time, no brighter gleam\\r , proceeded, than the reflection of certain sickly rays of the sun, which\\r , were sent back from its cold and shining surface.  A paper fly-cage\\r , dangled from the ceiling, to which he occasionally raised his eyes in\\r , gloomy thought; and, as the heedless insects hovered round the gaudy\\r , net-work, Mr. Bumble would heave a deep sigh, while a more gloomy\\r , shadow overspread his countenance.  Mr. Bumble was meditating; it might\\r , be that the insects brought to mind, some painful passage in his own\\r , past life.\\r , \\r , Nor was Mr. Bumble\\'s gloom the only thing calculated to awaken a\\r , pleasing melancholy in the bosom of a spectator. There were not wanting\\r , other appearances, and those closely connected with his own person,\\r , which announced that a great change had taken place in the position of\\r , his affairs.  The laced coat, and the cocked hat; where were they?  He\\r , still wore knee-breeches, and dark cotton stockings on his nether\\r , limbs; but they were not _the_ breeches.  The coat was wide-skirted;\\r , and in that respect like _the_ coat, but, oh how different!  The mighty\\r , cocked hat was replaced by a modest round one.  Mr. Bumble was no\\r , longer a beadle.\\r , \\r , There are some promotions in life, which, independent of the more\\r , substantial rewards they offer, require peculiar value and dignity from\\r , the coats and waistcoats connected with them.  A field-marshal has his\\r , uniform; a bishop his silk apron; a counsellor his silk gown; a beadle\\r , his cocked hat.  Strip the bishop of his apron, or the beadle of his\\r , hat and lace; what are they?  Men.  Mere men.  Dignity, and even\\r , holiness too, sometimes, are more questions of coat and waistcoat than\\r , some people imagine.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble had married Mrs. Corney, and was master of the workhouse.\\r , Another beadle had come into power.  On him the cocked hat, gold-laced\\r , coat, and staff, had all three descended.\\r , \\r , \\'And to-morrow two months it was done!\\' said Mr. Bumble, with a sigh.\\r , \\'It seems a age.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble might have meant that he had concentrated a whole existence\\r , of happiness into the short space of eight weeks; but the sigh--there\\r , was a vast deal of meaning in the sigh.\\r , \\r , \\'I sold myself,\\' said Mr. Bumble, pursuing the same train of relection,\\r , \\'for six teaspoons, a pair of sugar-tongs, and a milk-pot; with a small\\r , quantity of second-hand furniture, and twenty pound in money.  I went\\r , very reasonable.  Cheap, dirt cheap!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Cheap!\\' cried a shrill voice in Mr. Bumble\\'s ear: \\'you would have been\\r , dear at any price; and dear enough I paid for you, Lord above knows\\r , that!\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble turned, and encountered the face of his interesting consort,\\r , who, imperfectly comprehending the few words she had overheard of his\\r , complaint, had hazarded the foregoing remark at a venture.\\r , \\r , \\'Mrs. Bumble, ma\\'am!\\' said Mr. Bumble, with a sentimental sternness.\\r , \\r , \\'Well!\\' cried the lady.\\r , \\r , \\'Have the goodness to look at me,\\' said Mr. Bumble, fixing his eyes\\r , upon her.  (If she stands such a eye as that,\\' said Mr. Bumble to\\r , himself, \\'she can stand anything.  It is a eye I never knew to fail\\r , with paupers.  If it fails with her, my power is gone.\\')\\r , \\r , Whether an exceedingly small expansion of eye be sufficient to quell\\r , paupers, who, being lightly fed, are in no very high condition; or\\r , whether the late Mrs. Corney was particularly proof against eagle\\r , glances; are matters of opinion.  The matter of fact, is, that the\\r , matron was in no way overpowered by Mr. Bumble\\'s scowl, but, on the\\r , contrary, treated it with great disdain, and even raised a laugh\\r , thereat, which sounded as though it were genuine.\\r , \\r , On hearing this most unexpected sound, Mr. Bumble looked, first\\r , incredulous, and afterwards amazed.  He then relapsed into his former\\r , state; nor did he rouse himself until his attention was again awakened\\r , by the voice of his partner.\\r , \\r , \\'Are you going to sit snoring there, all day?\\' inquired Mrs. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'I am going to sit here, as long as I think proper, ma\\'am,\\' rejoined\\r , Mr. Bumble; \\'and although I was _not_ snoring, I shall snore, gape,\\r , sneeze, laugh, or cry, as the humour strikes me; such being my\\r , prerogative.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'_Your_ prerogative!\\' sneered Mrs. Bumble, with ineffable contempt.\\r , \\r , \\'I said the word, ma\\'am,\\' said Mr. Bumble.  \\'The prerogative of a man\\r , is to command.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And what\\'s the prerogative of a woman, in the name of Goodness?\\' cried\\r , the relict of Mr. Corney deceased.\\r , \\r , \\'To obey, ma\\'am,\\' thundered Mr. Bumble.  \\'Your late unfortunate husband\\r , should have taught it you; and then, perhaps, he might have been alive\\r , now.  I wish he was, poor man!\\'\\r , \\r , Mrs. Bumble, seeing at a glance, that the decisive moment had now\\r , arrived, and that a blow struck for the mastership on one side or\\r , other, must necessarily be final and conclusive, no sooner heard this\\r , allusion to the dead and gone, than she dropped into a chair, and with\\r , a loud scream that Mr. Bumble was a hard-hearted brute, fell into a\\r , paroxysm of tears.\\r , \\r , But, tears were not the things to find their way to Mr. Bumble\\'s soul;\\r , his heart was waterproof.  Like washable beaver hats that improve with\\r , rain, his nerves were rendered stouter and more vigorous, by showers of\\r , tears, which, being tokens of weakness, and so far tacit admissions of\\r , his own power, pleased and exalted him.  He eyed his good lady with\\r , looks of great satisfaction, and begged, in an encouraging manner, that\\r , she should cry her hardest:  the exercise being looked upon, by the\\r , faculty, as strongly conducive to health.\\r , \\r , \\'It opens the lungs, washes the countenance, exercises the eyes, and\\r , softens down the temper,\\' said Mr. Bumble.  \\'So cry away.\\'\\r , \\r , As he discharged himself of this pleasantry, Mr. Bumble took his hat\\r , from a peg, and putting it on, rather rakishly, on one side, as a man\\r , might, who felt he had asserted his superiority in a becoming manner,\\r , thrust his hands into his pockets, and sauntered towards the door, with\\r , much ease and waggishness depicted in his whole appearance.\\r , \\r , Now, Mrs. Corney that was, had tried the tears, because they were less\\r , troublesome than a manual assault; but, she was quite prepared to make\\r , trial of the latter mode of proceeding, as Mr. Bumble was not long in\\r , discovering.\\r , \\r , The first proof he experienced of the fact, was conveyed in a hollow\\r , sound, immediately succeeded by the sudden flying off of his hat to the\\r , opposite end of the room.  This preliminary proceeding laying bare his\\r , head, the expert lady, clasping him tightly round the throat with one\\r , hand, inflicted a shower of blows (dealt with singular vigour and\\r , dexterity) upon it with the other.  This done, she created a little\\r , variety by scratching his face, and tearing his hair; and, having, by\\r , this time, inflicted as much punishment as she deemed necessary for the\\r , offence, she pushed him over a chair, which was luckily well situated\\r , for the purpose:  and defied him to talk about his prerogative again,\\r , if he dared.\\r , \\r , \\'Get up!\\' said Mrs. Bumble, in a voice of command.  \\'And take yourself\\r , away from here, unless you want me to do something desperate.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble rose with a very rueful countenance:  wondering much what\\r , something desperate might be.  Picking up his hat, he looked towards\\r , the door.\\r , \\r , \\'Are you going?\\' demanded Mrs. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'Certainly, my dear, certainly,\\' rejoined Mr. Bumble, making a quicker\\r , motion towards the door.  \\'I didn\\'t intend to--I\\'m going, my dear!  You\\r , are so very violent, that really I--\\'\\r , \\r , At this instant, Mrs. Bumble stepped hastily forward to replace the\\r , carpet, which had been kicked up in the scuffle.  Mr. Bumble\\r , immediately darted out of the room, without bestowing another thought\\r , on his unfinished sentence:  leaving the late Mrs. Corney in full\\r , possession of the field.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble was fairly taken by surprise, and fairly beaten.  He had a\\r , decided propensity for bullying:  derived no inconsiderable pleasure\\r , from the exercise of petty cruelty; and, consequently, was (it is\\r , needless to say) a coward.  This is by no means a disparagement to his\\r , character; for many official personages, who are held in high respect\\r , and admiration, are the victims of similar infirmities.  The remark is\\r , made, indeed, rather in his favour than otherwise, and with a view of\\r , impressing the reader with a just sense of his qualifications for\\r , office.\\r , \\r , But, the measure of his degradation was not yet full.  After making a\\r , tour of the house, and thinking, for the first time, that the poor-laws\\r , really were too hard on people; and that men who ran away from their\\r , wives, leaving them chargeable to the parish, ought, in justice to be\\r , visited with no punishment at all, but rather rewarded as meritorious\\r , individuals who had suffered much; Mr. Bumble came to a room where some\\r , of the female paupers were usually employed in washing the parish\\r , linen:  when the sound of voices in conversation, now proceeded.\\r , \\r , \\'Hem!\\' said Mr. Bumble, summoning up all his native dignity. \\'These\\r , women at least shall continue to respect the prerogative. Hallo! hallo\\r , there!  What do you mean by this noise, you hussies?\\'\\r , \\r , With these words, Mr. Bumble opened the door, and walked in with a very\\r , fierce and angry manner:  which was at once exchanged for a most\\r , humiliated and cowering air, as his eyes unexpectedly rested on the\\r , form of his lady wife.\\r , \\r , \\'My dear,\\' said Mr. Bumble, \\'I didn\\'t know you were here.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Didn\\'t know I was here!\\' repeated Mrs. Bumble.  \\'What do _you_ do\\r , here?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I thought they were talking rather too much to be doing their work\\r , properly, my dear,\\' replied Mr. Bumble:  glancing distractedly at a\\r , couple of old women at the wash-tub, who were comparing notes of\\r , admiration at the workhouse-master\\'s humility.\\r , \\r , \\'_You_ thought they were talking too much?\\' said Mrs. Bumble. \\'What\\r , business is it of yours?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why, my dear--\\' urged Mr. Bumble submissively.\\r , \\r , \\'What business is it of yours?\\' demanded Mrs. Bumble, again.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s very true, you\\'re matron here, my dear,\\' submitted Mr. Bumble;\\r , \\'but I thought you mightn\\'t be in the way just then.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ll tell you what, Mr. Bumble,\\' returned his lady.  \\'We don\\'t want\\r , any of your interference.  You\\'re a great deal too fond of poking your\\r , nose into things that don\\'t concern you, making everybody in the house\\r , laugh, the moment your back is turned, and making yourself look like a\\r , fool every hour in the day.  Be off; come!\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble, seeing with excruciating feelings, the delight of the two\\r , old paupers, who were tittering together most rapturously, hesitated\\r , for an instant.  Mrs. Bumble, whose patience brooked no delay, caught\\r , up a bowl of soap-suds, and motioning him towards the door, ordered him\\r , instantly to depart, on pain of receiving the contents upon his portly\\r , person.\\r , \\r , What could Mr. Bumble do?  He looked dejectedly round, and slunk away;\\r , and, as he reached the door, the titterings of the paupers broke into a\\r , shrill chuckle of irrepressible delight.  It wanted but this.  He was\\r , degraded in their eyes; he had lost caste and station before the very\\r , paupers; he had fallen from all the height and pomp of beadleship, to\\r , the lowest depth of the most snubbed hen-peckery.\\r , \\r , \\'All in two months!\\' said Mr. Bumble, filled with dismal thoughts.\\r , \\'Two months!  No more than two months ago, I was not only my own\\r , master, but everybody else\\'s, so far as the porochial workhouse was\\r , concerned, and now!--\\'\\r , \\r , It was too much.  Mr. Bumble boxed the ears of the boy who opened the\\r , gate for him (for he had reached the portal in his reverie); and\\r , walked, distractedly, into the street.\\r , \\r , He walked up one street, and down another, until exercise had abated\\r , the first passion of his grief; and then the revulsion of feeling made\\r , him thirsty.  He passed a great many public-houses; but, at length\\r , paused before one in a by-way, whose parlour, as he gathered from a\\r , hasty peep over the blinds, was deserted, save by one solitary\\r , customer.  It began to rain, heavily, at the moment.  This determined\\r , him.  Mr. Bumble stepped in; and ordering something to drink, as he\\r , passed the bar, entered the apartment into which he had looked from the\\r , street.\\r , \\r , The man who was seated there, was tall and dark, and wore a large\\r , cloak.  He had the air of a stranger; and seemed, by a certain\\r , haggardness in his look, as well as by the dusty soils on his dress, to\\r , have travelled some distance.  He eyed Bumble askance, as he entered,\\r , but scarcely deigned to nod his head in acknowledgment of his\\r , salutation.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble had quite dignity enough for two; supposing even that the\\r , stranger had been more familiar:  so he drank his gin-and-water in\\r , silence, and read the paper with great show of pomp and circumstance.\\r , \\r , It so happened, however: as it will happen very often, when men fall\\r , into company under such circumstances:  that Mr. Bumble felt, every now\\r , and then, a powerful inducement, which he could not resist, to steal a\\r , look at the stranger:  and that whenever he did so, he withdrew his\\r , eyes, in some confusion, to find that the stranger was at that moment\\r , stealing a look at him.  Mr. Bumble\\'s awkwardness was enhanced by the\\r , very remarkable expression of the stranger\\'s eye, which was keen and\\r , bright, but shadowed by a scowl of distrust and suspicion, unlike\\r , anything he had ever observed before, and repulsive to behold.\\r , \\r , When they had encountered each other\\'s glance several times in this\\r , way, the stranger, in a harsh, deep voice, broke silence.\\r , \\r , \\'Were you looking for me,\\' he said, \\'when you peered in at the window?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not that I am aware of, unless you\\'re Mr.--\\'  Here Mr. Bumble stopped\\r , short; for he was curious to know the stranger\\'s name, and thought in\\r , his impatience, he might supply the blank.\\r , \\r , \\'I see you were not,\\' said the stranger; an expression of quiet sarcasm\\r , playing about his mouth; \\'or you have known my name.  You don\\'t know\\r , it.  I would recommend you not to ask for it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I meant no harm, young man,\\' observed Mr. Bumble, majestically.\\r , \\r , \\'And have done none,\\' said the stranger.\\r , \\r , Another silence succeeded this short dialogue:  which was again broken\\r , by the stranger.\\r , \\r , \\'I have seen you before, I think?\\' said he.  \\'You were differently\\r , dressed at that time, and I only passed you in the street, but I should\\r , know you again.  You were beadle here, once; were you not?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I was,\\' said Mr. Bumble, in some surprise; \\'porochial beadle.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Just so,\\' rejoined the other, nodding his head.  \\'It was in that\\r , character I saw you.  What are you now?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Master of the workhouse,\\' rejoined Mr. Bumble, slowly and\\r , impressively, to check any undue familiarity the stranger might\\r , otherwise assume.  \\'Master of the workhouse, young man!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You have the same eye to your own interest, that you always had, I\\r , doubt not?\\' resumed the stranger, looking keenly into Mr. Bumble\\'s\\r , eyes, as he raised them in astonishment at the question.\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t scruple to answer freely, man.  I know you pretty well, you see.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I suppose, a married man,\\' replied Mr. Bumble, shading his eyes with\\r , his hand, and surveying the stranger, from head to foot, in evident\\r , perplexity, \\'is not more averse to turning an honest penny when he can,\\r , than a single one.  Porochial officers are not so well paid that they\\r , can afford to refuse any little extra fee, when it comes to them in a\\r , civil and proper manner.\\'\\r , \\r , The stranger smiled, and nodded his head again: as much to say, he had\\r , not mistaken his man; then rang the bell.\\r , \\r , \\'Fill this glass again,\\' he said, handing Mr. Bumble\\'s empty tumbler to\\r , the landlord.  \\'Let it be strong and hot.  You like it so, I suppose?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not too strong,\\' replied Mr. Bumble, with a delicate cough.\\r , \\r , \\'You understand what that means, landlord!\\' said the stranger, drily.\\r , \\r , The host smiled, disappeared, and shortly afterwards returned with a\\r , steaming jorum: of which, the first gulp brought the water into Mr.\\r , Bumble\\'s eyes.\\r , \\r , \\'Now listen to me,\\' said the stranger, after closing the door and\\r , window.  \\'I came down to this place, to-day, to find you out; and, by\\r , one of those chances which the devil throws in the way of his friends\\r , sometimes, you walked into the very room I was sitting in, while you\\r , were uppermost in my mind.  I want some information from you.  I don\\'t\\r , ask you to give it for nothing, slight as it is.  Put up that, to begin\\r , with.\\'\\r , \\r , As he spoke, he pushed a couple of sovereigns across the table to his\\r , companion, carefully, as though unwilling that the chinking of money\\r , should be heard without.  When Mr. Bumble had scrupulously examined the\\r , coins, to see that they were genuine, and had put them up, with much\\r , satisfaction, in his waistcoat-pocket, he went on:\\r , \\r , \\'Carry your memory back--let me see--twelve years, last winter.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s a long time,\\' said Mr. Bumble.  \\'Very good.  I\\'ve done it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The scene, the workhouse.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Good!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And the time, night.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And the place, the crazy hole, wherever it was, in which miserable\\r , drabs brought forth the life and health so often denied to\\r , themselves--gave birth to puling children for the parish to rear; and\\r , hid their shame, rot \\'em in the grave!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The lying-in room, I suppose?\\' said Mr. Bumble, not quite following\\r , the stranger\\'s excited description.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' said the stranger.  \\'A boy was born there.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'A many boys,\\' observed Mr. Bumble, shaking his head, despondingly.\\r , \\r , \\'A murrain on the young devils!\\' cried the stranger; \\'I speak of one; a\\r , meek-looking, pale-faced boy, who was apprenticed down here, to a\\r , coffin-maker--I wish he had made his coffin, and screwed his body in\\r , it--and who afterwards ran away to London, as it was supposed.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, you mean Oliver!  Young Twist!\\' said Mr. Bumble; \\'I remember him,\\r , of course.  There wasn\\'t a obstinater young rascal--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s not of him I want to hear; I\\'ve heard enough of him,\\' said the\\r , stranger, stopping Mr. Bumble in the outset of a tirade on the subject\\r , of poor Oliver\\'s vices.  \\'It\\'s of a woman; the hag that nursed his\\r , mother.  Where is she?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Where is she?\\' said Mr. Bumble, whom the gin-and-water had rendered\\r , facetious.  \\'It would be hard to tell.  There\\'s no midwifery there,\\r , whichever place she\\'s gone to; so I suppose she\\'s out of employment,\\r , anyway.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What do you mean?\\' demanded the stranger, sternly.\\r , \\r , \\'That she died last winter,\\' rejoined Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , The man looked fixedly at him when he had given this information, and\\r , although he did not withdraw his eyes for some time afterwards, his\\r , gaze gradually became vacant and abstracted, and he seemed lost in\\r , thought.  For some time, he appeared doubtful whether he ought to be\\r , relieved or disappointed by the intelligence; but at length he breathed\\r , more freely; and withdrawing his eyes, observed that it was no great\\r , matter. With that he rose, as if to depart.\\r , \\r , But Mr. Bumble was cunning enough; and he at once saw that an\\r , opportunity was opened, for the lucrative disposal of some secret in\\r , the possession of his better half.  He well remembered the night of old\\r , Sally\\'s death, which the occurrences of that day had given him good\\r , reason to recollect, as the occasion on which he had proposed to Mrs.\\r , Corney; and although that lady had never confided to him the disclosure\\r , of which she had been the solitary witness, he had heard enough to know\\r , that it related to something that had occurred in the old woman\\'s\\r , attendance, as workhouse nurse, upon the young mother of Oliver Twist.\\r , Hastily calling this circumstance to mind, he informed the stranger,\\r , with an air of mystery, that one woman had been closeted with the old\\r , harridan shortly before she died; and that she could, as he had reason\\r , to believe, throw some light on the subject of his inquiry.\\r , \\r , \\'How can I find her?\\' said the stranger, thrown off his guard; and\\r , plainly showing that all his fears (whatever they were) were aroused\\r , afresh by the intelligence.\\r , \\r , \\'Only through me,\\' rejoined Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'When?\\' cried the stranger, hastily.\\r , \\r , \\'To-morrow,\\' rejoined Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'At nine in the evening,\\' said the stranger, producing a scrap of\\r , paper, and writing down upon it, an obscure address by the water-side,\\r , in characters that betrayed his agitation; \\'at nine in the evening,\\r , bring her to me there.  I needn\\'t tell you to be secret.  It\\'s your\\r , interest.\\'\\r , \\r , With these words, he led the way to the door, after stopping to pay for\\r , the liquor that had been drunk.  Shortly remarking that their roads\\r , were different, he departed, without more ceremony than an emphatic\\r , repetition of the hour of appointment for the following night.\\r , \\r , On glancing at the address, the parochial functionary observed that it\\r , contained no name.  The stranger had not gone far, so he made after him\\r , to ask it.\\r , \\r , \\'What do you want?\\' cried the man, turning quickly round, as Bumble\\r , touched him on the arm.  \\'Following me?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Only to ask a question,\\' said the other, pointing to the scrap of\\r , paper.  \\'What name am I to ask for?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Monks!\\' rejoined the man; and strode hastily, away.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXXVIII\\r , \\r , CONTAINING AN ACCOUNT OF WHAT PASSED BETWEEN MR. AND MRS. BUMBLE, AND\\r , MR. MONKS, AT THEIR NOCTURNAL INTERVIEW\\r , \\r , It was a dull, close, overcast summer evening.  The clouds, which had\\r , been threatening all day, spread out in a dense and sluggish mass of\\r , vapour, already yielded large drops of rain, and seemed to presage a\\r , violent thunder-storm, when Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, turning out of the\\r , main street of the town, directed their course towards a scattered\\r , little colony of ruinous houses, distant from it some mile and a-half,\\r , or thereabouts, and erected on a low unwholesome swamp, bordering upon\\r , the river.\\r , \\r , They were both wrapped in old and shabby outer garments, which might,\\r , perhaps, serve the double purpose of protecting their persons from the\\r , rain, and sheltering them from observation.  The husband carried a\\r , lantern, from which, however, no light yet shone; and trudged on, a few\\r , paces in front, as though--the way being dirty--to give his wife the\\r , benefit of treading in his heavy footprints.  They went on, in profound\\r , silence; every now and then, Mr. Bumble relaxed his pace, and turned\\r , his head as if to make sure that his helpmate was following; then,\\r , discovering that she was close at his heels, he mended his rate of\\r , walking, and proceeded, at a considerable increase of speed, towards\\r , their place of destination.\\r , \\r , This was far from being a place of doubtful character; for it had long\\r , been known as the residence of none but low ruffians, who, under\\r , various pretences of living by their labour, subsisted chiefly on\\r , plunder and crime.  It was a collection of mere hovels:  some, hastily\\r , built with loose bricks: others, of old worm-eaten ship-timber: jumbled\\r , together without any attempt at order or arrangement, and planted, for\\r , the most part, within a few feet of the river\\'s bank.  A few leaky\\r , boats drawn up on the mud, and made fast to the dwarf wall which\\r , skirted it:  and here and there an oar or coil of rope:  appeared, at\\r , first, to indicate that the inhabitants of these miserable cottages\\r , pursued some avocation on the river; but a glance at the shattered and\\r , useless condition of the articles thus displayed, would have led a\\r , passer-by, without much difficulty, to the conjecture that they were\\r , disposed there, rather for the preservation of appearances, than with\\r , any view to their being actually employed.\\r , \\r , In the heart of this cluster of huts; and skirting the river, which its\\r , upper stories overhung; stood a large building, formerly used as a\\r , manufactory of some kind.  It had, in its day, probably furnished\\r , employment to the inhabitants of the surrounding tenements.  But it had\\r , long since gone to ruin.  The rat, the worm, and the action of the\\r , damp, had weakened and rotted the piles on which it stood; and a\\r , considerable portion of the building had already sunk down into the\\r , water; while the remainder, tottering and bending over the dark stream,\\r , seemed to wait a favourable opportunity of following its old companion,\\r , and involving itself in the same fate.\\r , \\r , It was before this ruinous building that the worthy couple paused, as\\r , the first peal of distant thunder reverberated in the air, and the rain\\r , commenced pouring violently down.\\r , \\r , \\'The place should be somewhere here,\\' said Bumble, consulting a scrap\\r , of paper he held in his hand.\\r , \\r , \\'Halloa there!\\' cried a voice from above.\\r , \\r , Following the sound, Mr. Bumble raised his head and descried a man\\r , looking out of a door, breast-high, on the second story.\\r , \\r , \\'Stand still, a minute,\\' cried the voice; \\'I\\'ll be with you directly.\\'\\r , With which the head disappeared, and the door closed.\\r , \\r , \\'Is that the man?\\' asked Mr. Bumble\\'s good lady.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble nodded in the affirmative.\\r , \\r , \\'Then, mind what I told you,\\' said the matron: \\'and be careful to say\\r , as little as you can, or you\\'ll betray us at once.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble, who had eyed the building with very rueful looks, was\\r , apparently about to express some doubts relative to the advisability of\\r , proceeding any further with the enterprise just then, when he was\\r , prevented by the appearance of Monks: who opened a small door, near\\r , which they stood, and beckoned them inwards.\\r , \\r , \\'Come in!\\' he cried impatiently, stamping his foot upon the ground.\\r , \\'Don\\'t keep me here!\\'\\r , \\r , The woman, who had hesitated at first, walked boldly in, without any\\r , other invitation.  Mr. Bumble, who was ashamed or afraid to lag behind,\\r , followed:  obviously very ill at ease and with scarcely any of that\\r , remarkable dignity which was usually his chief characteristic.\\r , \\r , \\'What the devil made you stand lingering there, in the wet?\\' said\\r , Monks, turning round, and addressing Bumble, after he had bolted the\\r , door behind them.\\r , \\r , \\'We--we were only cooling ourselves,\\' stammered Bumble, looking\\r , apprehensively about him.\\r , \\r , \\'Cooling yourselves!\\' retorted Monks.  \\'Not all the rain that ever\\r , fell, or ever will fall, will put as much of hell\\'s fire out, as a man\\r , can carry about with him.  You won\\'t cool yourself so easily; don\\'t\\r , think it!\\'\\r , \\r , With this agreeable speech, Monks turned short upon the matron, and\\r , bent his gaze upon her, till even she, who was not easily cowed, was\\r , fain to withdraw her eyes, and turn them towards the ground.\\r , \\r , \\'This is the woman, is it?\\' demanded Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'Hem!  That is the woman,\\' replied Mr. Bumble, mindful of his wife\\'s\\r , caution.\\r , \\r , \\'You think women never can keep secrets, I suppose?\\' said the matron,\\r , interposing, and returning, as she spoke, the searching look of Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'I know they will always keep _one_ till it\\'s found out,\\' said Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'And what may that be?\\' asked the matron.\\r , \\r , \\'The loss of their own good name,\\' replied Monks.  \\'So, by the same\\r , rule, if a woman\\'s a party to a secret that might hang or transport\\r , her, I\\'m not afraid of her telling it to anybody; not I!  Do you\\r , understand, mistress?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' rejoined the matron, slightly colouring as she spoke.\\r , \\r , \\'Of course you don\\'t!\\' said Monks.  \\'How should you?\\'\\r , \\r , Bestowing something half-way between a smile and a frown upon his two\\r , companions, and again beckoning them to follow him, the man hastened\\r , across the apartment, which was of considerable extent, but low in the\\r , roof.  He was preparing to ascend a steep staircase, or rather ladder,\\r , leading to another floor of warehouses above:  when a bright flash of\\r , lightning streamed down the aperture, and a peal of thunder followed,\\r , which shook the crazy building to its centre.\\r , \\r , \\'Hear it!\\' he cried, shrinking back.  \\'Hear it!  Rolling and crashing\\r , on as if it echoed through a thousand caverns where the devils were\\r , hiding from it.  I hate the sound!\\'\\r , \\r , He remained silent for a few moments; and then, removing his hands\\r , suddenly from his face, showed, to the unspeakable discomposure of Mr.\\r , Bumble, that it was much distorted and discoloured.\\r , \\r , \\'These fits come over me, now and then,\\' said Monks, observing his\\r , alarm; \\'and thunder sometimes brings them on. Don\\'t mind me now; it\\'s\\r , all over for this once.\\'\\r , \\r , Thus speaking, he led the way up the ladder; and hastily closing the\\r , window-shutter of the room into which it led, lowered a lantern which\\r , hung at the end of a rope and pulley passed through one of the heavy\\r , beams in the ceiling:  and which cast a dim light upon an old table and\\r , three chairs that were placed beneath it.\\r , \\r , \\'Now,\\' said Monks, when they had all three seated themselves, \\'the\\r , sooner we come to our business, the better for all.  The woman know\\r , what it is, does she?\\'\\r , \\r , The question was addressed to Bumble; but his wife anticipated the\\r , reply, by intimating that she was perfectly acquainted with it.\\r , \\r , \\'He is right in saying that you were with this hag the night she died;\\r , and that she told you something--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'About the mother of the boy you named,\\' replied the matron\\r , interrupting him.  \\'Yes.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The first question is, of what nature was her communication?\\' said\\r , Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s the second,\\' observed the woman with much deliberation. \\'The\\r , first is, what may the communication be worth?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Who the devil can tell that, without knowing of what kind it is?\\'\\r , asked Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'Nobody better than you, I am persuaded,\\' answered Mrs. Bumble: who did\\r , not want for spirit, as her yoke-fellow could abundantly testify.\\r , \\r , \\'Humph!\\' said Monks significantly, and with a look of eager inquiry;\\r , \\'there may be money\\'s worth to get, eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Perhaps there may,\\' was the composed reply.\\r , \\r , \\'Something that was taken from her,\\' said Monks.  \\'Something that she\\r , wore.  Something that--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You had better bid,\\' interrupted Mrs. Bumble.  \\'I have heard enough,\\r , already, to assure me that you are the man I ought to talk to.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble, who had not yet been admitted by his better half into any\\r , greater share of the secret than he had originally possessed, listened\\r , to this dialogue with outstretched neck and distended eyes:  which he\\r , directed towards his wife and Monks, by turns, in undisguised\\r , astonishment; increased, if possible, when the latter sternly demanded,\\r , what sum was required for the disclosure.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s it worth to you?\\' asked the woman, as collectedly as before.\\r , \\r , \\'It may be nothing; it may be twenty pounds,\\' replied Monks. \\'Speak\\r , out, and let me know which.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Add five pounds to the sum you have named; give me five-and-twenty\\r , pounds in gold,\\' said the woman; \\'and I\\'ll tell you all I know.  Not\\r , before.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Five-and-twenty pounds!\\' exclaimed Monks, drawing back.\\r , \\r , \\'I spoke as plainly as I could,\\' replied Mrs. Bumble.  \\'It\\'s not a\\r , large sum, either.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not a large sum for a paltry secret, that may be nothing when it\\'s\\r , told!\\' cried Monks impatiently; \\'and which has been lying dead for\\r , twelve years past or more!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Such matters keep well, and, like good wine, often double their value\\r , in course of time,\\' answered the matron, still preserving the resolute\\r , indifference she had assumed.  \\'As to lying dead, there are those who\\r , will lie dead for twelve thousand years to come, or twelve million, for\\r , anything you or I know, who will tell strange tales at last!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What if I pay it for nothing?\\' asked Monks, hesitating.\\r , \\r , \\'You can easily take it away again,\\' replied the matron. \\'I am but a\\r , woman; alone here; and unprotected.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not alone, my dear, nor unprotected, neither,\\' submitted Mr. Bumble,\\r , in a voice tremulous with fear: \\'_I_ am here, my dear. And besides,\\'\\r , said Mr. Bumble, his teeth chattering as he spoke, \\'Mr. Monks is too\\r , much of a gentleman to attempt any violence on porochial persons.  Mr.\\r , Monks is aware that I am not a young man, my dear, and also that I am a\\r , little run to seed, as I may say; bu he has heerd:  I say I have no\\r , doubt Mr. Monks has heerd, my dear:  that I am a very determined\\r , officer, with very uncommon strength, if I\\'m once roused.  I only want\\r , a little rousing; that\\'s all.\\'\\r , \\r , As Mr. Bumble spoke, he made a melancholy feint of grasping his lantern\\r , with fierce determination; and plainly showed, by the alarmed\\r , expression of every feature, that he _did_ want a little rousing, and\\r , not a little, prior to making any very warlike demonstration: unless,\\r , indeed, against paupers, or other person or persons trained down for\\r , the purpose.\\r , \\r , \\'You are a fool,\\' said Mrs. Bumble, in reply; \\'and had better hold your\\r , tongue.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He had better have cut it out, before he came, if he can\\'t speak in a\\r , lower tone,\\' said Monks, grimly.  \\'So!  He\\'s your husband, eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He my husband!\\' tittered the matron, parrying the question.\\r , \\r , \\'I thought as much, when you came in,\\' rejoined Monks, marking the\\r , angry glance which the lady darted at her spouse as she spoke.  \\'So\\r , much the better; I have less hesitation in dealing with two people,\\r , when I find that there\\'s only one will between them.  I\\'m in earnest.\\r , See here!\\'\\r , \\r , He thrust his hand into a side-pocket; and producing a canvas bag, told\\r , out twenty-five sovereigns on the table, and pushed them over to the\\r , woman.\\r , \\r , \\'Now,\\' he said, \\'gather them up; and when this cursed peal of thunder,\\r , which I feel is coming up to break over the house-top, is gone, let\\'s\\r , hear your story.\\'\\r , \\r , The thunder, which seemed in fact much nearer, and to shiver and break\\r , almost over their heads, having subsided, Monks, raising his face from\\r , the table, bent forward to listen to what the woman should say.  The\\r , faces of the three nearly touched, as the two men leant over the small\\r , table in their eagerness to hear, and the woman also leant forward to\\r , render her whisper audible.  The sickly rays of the suspended lantern\\r , falling directly upon them, aggravated the paleness and anxiety of\\r , their countenances: which, encircled by the deepest gloom and darkness,\\r , looked ghastly in the extreme.\\r , \\r , \\'When this woman, that we called old Sally, died,\\' the matron began,\\r , \\'she and I were alone.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Was there no one by?\\' asked Monks, in the same hollow whisper; \\'No\\r , sick wretch or idiot in some other bed?  No one who could hear, and\\r , might, by possibility, understand?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not a soul,\\' replied the woman; \\'we were alone.  _I_ stood alone\\r , beside the body when death came over it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Good,\\' said Monks, regarding her attentively.  \\'Go on.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'She spoke of a young creature,\\' resumed the matron, \\'who had brought a\\r , child into the world some years before; not merely in the same room,\\r , but in the same bed, in which she then lay dying.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ay?\\' said Monks, with quivering lip, and glancing over his shoulder,\\r , \\'Blood!  How things come about!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The child was the one you named to him last night,\\' said the matron,\\r , nodding carelessly towards her husband; \\'the mother this nurse had\\r , robbed.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'In life?\\' asked Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'In death,\\' replied the woman, with something like a shudder. \\'She\\r , stole from the corpse, when it had hardly turned to one, that which the\\r , dead mother had prayed her, with her last breath, to keep for the\\r , infant\\'s sake.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'She sold it,\\' cried Monks, with desperate eagerness; \\'did she sell it?\\r , Where?  When?  To whom?  How long before?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'As she told me, with great difficulty, that she had done this,\\' said\\r , the matron, \\'she fell back and died.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Without saying more?\\' cried Monks, in a voice which, from its very\\r , suppression, seemed only the more furious.  \\'It\\'s a lie! I\\'ll not be\\r , played with.  She said more.  I\\'ll tear the life out of you both, but\\r , I\\'ll know what it was.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'She didn\\'t utter another word,\\' said the woman, to all appearance\\r , unmoved (as Mr. Bumble was very far from being) by the strange man\\'s\\r , violence; \\'but she clutched my gown, violently, with one hand, which\\r , was partly closed; and when I saw that she was dead, and so removed the\\r , hand by force, I found it clasped a scrap of dirty paper.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Which contained--\\' interposed Monks, stretching forward.\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing,\\' replied the woman; \\'it was a pawnbroker\\'s duplicate.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'For what?\\' demanded Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'In good time I\\'ll tell you.\\' said the woman.  \\'I judge that she had\\r , kept the trinket, for some time, in the hope of turning it to better\\r , account; and then had pawned it; and had saved or scraped together\\r , money to pay the pawnbroker\\'s interest year by year, and prevent its\\r , running out; so that if anything came of it, it could still be\\r , redeemed.  Nothing had come of it; and, as I tell you, she died with\\r , the scrap of paper, all worn and tattered, in her hand.  The time was\\r , out in two days; I thought something might one day come of it too; and\\r , so redeemed the pledge.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Where is it now?\\' asked Monks quickly.\\r , \\r , \\'_There_,\\' replied the woman.  And, as if glad to be relieved of it,\\r , she hastily threw upon the table a small kid bag scarcely large enough\\r , for a French watch, which Monks pouncing upon, tore open with trembling\\r , hands.  It contained a little gold locket: in which were two locks of\\r , hair, and a plain gold wedding-ring.\\r , \\r , \\'It has the word \"Agnes\" engraved on the inside,\\' said the woman.\\r , \\r , \\'There is a blank left for the surname; and then follows the date;\\r , which is within a year before the child was born.  I found out that.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And this is all?\\' said Monks, after a close and eager scrutiny of the\\r , contents of the little packet.\\r , \\r , \\'All,\\' replied the woman.\\r , \\r , Mr. Bumble drew a long breath, as if he were glad to find that the\\r , story was over, and no mention made of taking the five-and-twenty\\r , pounds back again; and now he took courage to wipe the perspiration\\r , which had been trickling over his nose, unchecked, during the whole of\\r , the previous dialogue.\\r , \\r , \\'I know nothing of the story, beyond what I can guess at,\\' said his\\r , wife addressing Monks, after a short silence; \\'and I want to know\\r , nothing; for it\\'s safer not.  But I may ask you two questions, may I?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You may ask,\\' said Monks, with some show of surprise; \\'but whether I\\r , answer or not is another question.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'--Which makes three,\\' observed Mr. Bumble, essaying a stroke of\\r , facetiousness.\\r , \\r , \\'Is that what you expected to get from me?\\' demanded the matron.\\r , \\r , \\'It is,\\' replied Monks.  \\'The other question?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What do you propose to do with it?  Can it be used against me?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Never,\\' rejoined Monks; \\'nor against me either.  See here!  But don\\'t\\r , move a step forward, or your life is not worth a bulrush.\\'\\r , \\r , With these words, he suddenly wheeled the table aside, and pulling an\\r , iron ring in the boarding, threw back a large trap-door which opened\\r , close at Mr. Bumble\\'s feet, and caused that gentleman to retire several\\r , paces backward, with great precipitation.\\r , \\r , \\'Look down,\\' said Monks, lowering the lantern into the gulf. \\'Don\\'t\\r , fear me.  I could have let you down, quietly enough, when you were\\r , seated over it, if that had been my game.\\'\\r , \\r , Thus encouraged, the matron drew near to the brink; and even Mr. Bumble\\r , himself, impelled by curiousity, ventured to do the same. The turbid\\r , water, swollen by the heavy rain, was rushing rapidly on below; and all\\r , other sounds were lost in the noise of its plashing and eddying against\\r , the green and slimy piles.  There had once been a water-mill beneath;\\r , the tide foaming and chafing round the few rotten stakes, and fragments\\r , of machinery that yet remained, seemed to dart onward, with a new\\r , impulse, when freed from the obstacles which had unavailingly attempted\\r , to stem its headlong course.\\r , \\r , \\'If you flung a man\\'s body down there, where would it be to-morrow\\r , morning?\\' said Monks, swinging the lantern to and fro in the dark well.\\r , \\r , \\'Twelve miles down the river, and cut to pieces besides,\\' replied\\r , Bumble, recoiling at the thought.\\r , \\r , Monks drew the little packet from his breast, where he had hurriedly\\r , thrust it; and tying it to a leaden weight, which had formed a part of\\r , some pulley, and was lying on the floor, dropped it into the stream.\\r , It fell straight, and true as a die; clove the water with a scarcely\\r , audible splash; and was gone.\\r , \\r , The three looking into each other\\'s faces, seemed to breathe more\\r , freely.\\r , \\r , \\'There!\\' said Monks, closing the trap-door, which fell heavily back\\r , into its former position.  \\'If the sea ever gives up its dead, as books\\r , say it will, it will keep its gold and silver to itself, and that trash\\r , among it.  We have nothing more to say, and may break up our pleasant\\r , party.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'By all means,\\' observed Mr. Bumble, with great alacrity.\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'ll keep a quiet tongue in your head, will you?\\' said Monks, with a\\r , threatening look.  \\'I am not afraid of your wife.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You may depend upon me, young man,\\' answered Mr. Bumble, bowing\\r , himself gradually towards the ladder, with excessive politeness. \\'On\\r , everybody\\'s account, young man; on my own, you know, Mr. Monks.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I am glad, for your sake, to hear it,\\' remarked Monks. \\'Light your\\r , lantern!  And get away from here as fast as you can.\\'\\r , \\r , It was fortunate that the conversation terminated at this point, or Mr.\\r , Bumble, who had bowed himself to within six inches of the ladder, would\\r , infallibly have pitched headlong into the room below.  He lighted his\\r , lantern from that which Monks had detached from the rope, and now\\r , carried in his hand; and making no effort to prolong the discourse,\\r , descended in silence, followed by his wife.  Monks brought up the rear,\\r , after pausing on the steps to satisfy himself that there were no other\\r , sounds to be heard than the beating of the rain without, and the\\r , rushing of the water.\\r , \\r , They traversed the lower room, slowly, and with caution; for Monks\\r , started at every shadow; and Mr. Bumble, holding his lantern a foot\\r , above the ground, walked not only with remarkable care, but with a\\r , marvellously light step for a gentleman of his figure:  looking\\r , nervously about him for hidden trap-doors.  The gate at which they had\\r , entered, was softly unfastened and opened by Monks; merely exchanging a\\r , nod with their mysterious acquaintance, the married couple emerged into\\r , the wet and darkness outside.\\r , \\r , They were no sooner gone, than Monks, who appeared to entertain an\\r , invincible repugnance to being left alone, called to a boy who had been\\r , hidden somewhere below. Bidding him go first, and bear the light, he\\r , returned to the chamber he had just quitted.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XXXIX\\r , \\r , INTRODUCES SOME RESPECTABLE CHARACTERS WITH WHOM THE READER IS ALREADY\\r , ACQUAINTED, AND SHOWS HOW MONKS AND THE JEW LAID THEIR WORTHY HEADS\\r , TOGETHER\\r , \\r , On the evening following that upon which the three worthies mentioned\\r , in the last chapter, disposed of their little matter of business as\\r , therein narrated, Mr. William Sikes, awakening from a nap, drowsily\\r , growled forth an inquiry what time of night it was.\\r , \\r , The room in which Mr. Sikes propounded this question, was not one of\\r , those he had tenanted, previous to the Chertsey expedition, although it\\r , was in the same quarter of the town, and was situated at no great\\r , distance from his former lodgings.  It was not, in appearance, so\\r , desirable a habitation as his old quarters:  being a mean and\\r , badly-furnished apartment, of very limited size; lighted only by one\\r , small window in the shelving roof, and abutting on a close and dirty\\r , lane.  Nor were there wanting other indications of the good gentleman\\'s\\r , having gone down in the world of late:  for a great scarcity of\\r , furniture, and total absence of comfort, together with the\\r , disappearance of all such small moveables as spare clothes and linen,\\r , bespoke a state of extreme poverty; while the meagre and attenuated\\r , condition of Mr. Sikes himself would have fully confirmed these\\r , symptoms, if they had stood in any need of corroboration.\\r , \\r , The housebreaker was lying on the bed, wrapped in his white great-coat,\\r , by way of dressing-gown, and displaying a set of features in no degree\\r , improved by the cadaverous hue of illness, and the addition of a soiled\\r , nightcap, and a stiff, black beard of a week\\'s growth.  The dog sat at\\r , the bedside:  now eyeing his master with a wistful look, and now\\r , pricking his ears, and uttering a low growl as some noise in the\\r , street, or in the lower part of the house, attracted his attention.\\r , Seated by the window, busily engaged in patching an old waistcoat which\\r , formed a portion of the robber\\'s ordinary dress, was a female:  so pale\\r , and reduced with watching and privation, that there would have been\\r , considerable difficulty in recognising her as the same Nancy who has\\r , already figured in this tale, but for the voice in which she replied to\\r , Mr. Sikes\\'s question.\\r , \\r , \\'Not long gone seven,\\' said the girl.  \\'How do you feel to-night, Bill?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'As weak as water,\\' replied Mr. Sikes, with an imprecation on his eyes\\r , and limbs.  \\'Here; lend us a hand, and let me get off this thundering\\r , bed anyhow.\\'\\r , \\r , Illness had not improved Mr. Sikes\\'s temper; for, as the girl raised\\r , him up and led him to a chair, he muttered various curses on her\\r , awkwardness, and struck her.\\r , \\r , \\'Whining are you?\\' said Sikes.  \\'Come!  Don\\'t stand snivelling there.\\r , If you can\\'t do anything better than that, cut off altogether.  D\\'ye\\r , hear me?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I hear you,\\' replied the girl, turning her face aside, and forcing a\\r , laugh.  \\'What fancy have you got in your head now?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh! you\\'ve thought better of it, have you?\\' growled Sikes, marking the\\r , tear which trembled in her eye.  \\'All the better for you, you have.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why, you don\\'t mean to say, you\\'d be hard upon me to-night, Bill,\\'\\r , said the girl, laying her hand upon his shoulder.\\r , \\r , \\'No!\\' cried Mr. Sikes.  \\'Why not?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Such a number of nights,\\' said the girl, with a touch of woman\\'s\\r , tenderness, which communicated something like sweetness of tone, even\\r , to her voice: \\'such a number of nights as I\\'ve been patient with you,\\r , nursing and caring for you, as if you had been a child: and this the\\r , first that I\\'ve seen you like yourself; you wouldn\\'t have served me as\\r , you did just now, if you\\'d thought of that, would you?  Come, come; say\\r , you wouldn\\'t.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, then,\\' rejoined Mr. Sikes, \\'I wouldn\\'t.  Why, damme, now, the\\r , girls\\'s whining again!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s nothing,\\' said the girl, throwing herself into a chair. \\'Don\\'t\\r , you seem to mind me.  It\\'ll soon be over.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'ll be over?\\' demanded Mr. Sikes in a savage voice. \\'What foolery\\r , are you up to, now, again?  Get up and bustle about, and don\\'t come\\r , over me with your woman\\'s nonsense.\\'\\r , \\r , At any other time, this remonstrance, and the tone in which it was\\r , delivered, would have had the desired effect; but the girl being really\\r , weak and exhausted, dropped her head over the back of the chair, and\\r , fainted, before Mr. Sikes could get out a few of the appropriate oaths\\r , with which, on similar occasions, he was accustomed to garnish his\\r , threats.  Not knowing, very well, what to do, in this uncommon\\r , emergency; for Miss Nancy\\'s hysterics were usually of that violent kind\\r , which the patient fights and struggles out of, without much assistance;\\r , Mr. Sikes tried a little blasphemy: and finding that mode of treatment\\r , wholly ineffectual, called for assistance.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s the matter here, my dear?\\' said Fagin, looking in.\\r , \\r , \\'Lend a hand to the girl, can\\'t you?\\' replied Sikes impatiently. \\'Don\\'t\\r , stand chattering and grinning at me!\\'\\r , \\r , With an exclamation of surprise, Fagin hastened to the girl\\'s\\r , assistance, while Mr. John Dawkins (otherwise the Artful Dodger), who\\r , had followed his venerable friend into the room, hastily deposited on\\r , the floor a bundle with which he was laden; and snatching a bottle from\\r , the grasp of Master Charles Bates who came close at his heels, uncorked\\r , it in a twinkling with his teeth, and poured a portion of its contents\\r , down the patient\\'s throat:  previously taking a taste, himself, to\\r , prevent mistakes.\\r , \\r , \\'Give her a whiff of fresh air with the bellows, Charley,\\' said Mr.\\r , Dawkins; \\'and you slap her hands, Fagin, while Bill undoes the\\r , petticuts.\\'\\r , \\r , These united restoratives, administered with great energy: especially\\r , that department consigned to Master Bates, who appeared to consider his\\r , share in the proceedings, a piece of unexampled pleasantry:  were not\\r , long in producing the desired effect.  The girl gradually recovered her\\r , senses; and, staggering to a chair by the bedside, hid her face upon\\r , the pillow:  leaving Mr. Sikes to confront the new comers, in some\\r , astonishment at their unlooked-for appearance.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, what evil wind has blowed you here?\\' he asked Fagin.\\r , \\r , \\'No evil wind at all, my dear, for evil winds blow nobody any good; and\\r , I\\'ve brought something good with me, that you\\'ll be glad to see.\\r , Dodger, my dear, open the bundle; and give Bill the little trifles that\\r , we spent all our money on, this morning.\\'\\r , \\r , In compliance with Mr. Fagin\\'s request, the Artful untied this bundle,\\r , which was of large size, and formed of an old table-cloth; and handed\\r , the articles it contained, one by one, to Charley Bates: who placed\\r , them on the table, with various encomiums on their rarity and\\r , excellence.\\r , \\r , \\'Sitch a rabbit pie, Bill,\\' exclaimed that young gentleman, disclosing\\r , to view a huge pasty; \\'sitch delicate creeturs, with sitch tender\\r , limbs, Bill, that the wery bones melt in your mouth, and there\\'s no\\r , occasion to pick \\'em; half a pound of seven and six-penny green, so\\r , precious strong that if you mix it with biling water, it\\'ll go nigh to\\r , blow the lid of the tea-pot off; a pound and a half of moist sugar that\\r , the niggers didn\\'t work at all at, afore they got it up to sitch a\\r , pitch of goodness,--oh no!  Two half-quartern brans; pound of best\\r , fresh; piece of double Glo\\'ster; and, to wind up all, some of the\\r , richest sort you ever lushed!\\'\\r , \\r , Uttering this last panegyric, Master Bates produced, from one of his\\r , extensive pockets, a full-sized wine-bottle, carefully corked; while\\r , Mr. Dawkins, at the same instant, poured out a wine-glassful of raw\\r , spirits from the bottle he carried:  which the invalid tossed down his\\r , throat without a moment\\'s hesitation.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!\\' said Fagin, rubbing his hands with great satisfaction. \\'You\\'ll\\r , do, Bill; you\\'ll do now.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Do!\\' exclaimed Mr. Sikes; \\'I might have been done for, twenty times\\r , over, afore you\\'d have done anything to help me.  What do you mean by\\r , leaving a man in this state, three weeks and more, you false-hearted\\r , wagabond?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Only hear him, boys!\\' said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders. \\'And us\\r , come to bring him all these beau-ti-ful things.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The things is well enough in their way,\\' observed Mr. Sikes:  a little\\r , soothed as he glanced over the table; \\'but what have you got to say for\\r , yourself, why you should leave me here, down in the mouth, health,\\r , blunt, and everything else; and take no more notice of me, all this\\r , mortal time, than if I was that \\'ere dog.--Drive him down, Charley!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I never see such a jolly dog as that,\\' cried Master Bates, doing as he\\r , was desired.  \\'Smelling the grub like a old lady a going to market!\\r , He\\'d make his fortun\\' on the stage that dog would, and rewive the\\r , drayma besides.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hold your din,\\' cried Sikes, as the dog retreated under the bed: still\\r , growling angrily.  \\'What have you got to say for yourself, you withered\\r , old fence, eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I was away from London, a week and more, my dear, on a plant,\\' replied\\r , the Jew.\\r , \\r , \\'And what about the other fortnight?\\' demanded Sikes.  \\'What about the\\r , other fortnight that you\\'ve left me lying here, like a sick rat in his\\r , hole?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I couldn\\'t help it, Bill.  I can\\'t go into a long explanation before\\r , company; but I couldn\\'t help it, upon my honour.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Upon your what?\\' growled Sikes, with excessive disgust. \\'Here! Cut me\\r , off a piece of that pie, one of you boys, to take the taste of that out\\r , of my mouth, or it\\'ll choke me dead.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t be out of temper, my dear,\\' urged Fagin, submissively. \\'I have\\r , never forgot you, Bill; never once.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No!  I\\'ll pound it that you han\\'t,\\' replied Sikes, with a bitter grin.\\r , \\'You\\'ve been scheming and plotting away, every hour that I have laid\\r , shivering and burning here; and Bill was to do this; and Bill was to do\\r , that; and Bill was to do it all, dirt cheap, as soon as he got well:\\r , and was quite poor enough for your work. If it hadn\\'t been for the\\r , girl, I might have died.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'There now, Bill,\\' remonstrated Fagin, eagerly catching at the word.\\r , \\'If it hadn\\'t been for the girl!  Who but poor ould Fagin was the means\\r , of your having such a handy girl about you?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He says true enough there!\\' said Nancy, coming hastily forward. \\'Let\\r , him be; let him be.\\'\\r , \\r , Nancy\\'s appearance gave a new turn to the conversation; for the boys,\\r , receiving a sly wink from the wary old Jew, began to ply her with\\r , liquor: of which, however, she took very sparingly; while Fagin,\\r , assuming an unusual flow of spirits, gradually brought Mr. Sikes into a\\r , better temper, by affecting to regard his threats as a little pleasant\\r , banter; and, moreover, by laughing very heartily at one or two rough\\r , jokes, which, after repeated applications to the spirit-bottle, he\\r , condescended to make.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s all very well,\\' said Mr. Sikes; \\'but I must have some blunt from\\r , you to-night.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I haven\\'t a piece of coin about me,\\' replied the Jew.\\r , \\r , \\'Then you\\'ve got lots at home,\\' retorted Sikes; \\'and I must have some\\r , from there.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Lots!\\' cried Fagin, holding up is hands.  \\'I haven\\'t so much as\\r , would--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t know how much you\\'ve got, and I dare say you hardly know\\r , yourself, as it would take a pretty long time to count it,\\' said Sikes;\\r , \\'but I must have some to-night; and that\\'s flat.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, well,\\' said Fagin, with a sigh, \\'I\\'ll send the Artful round\\r , presently.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You won\\'t do nothing of the kind,\\' rejoined Mr. Sikes. \\'The Artful\\'s a\\r , deal too artful, and would forget to come, or lose his way, or get\\r , dodged by traps and so be perwented, or anything for an excuse, if you\\r , put him up to it.  Nancy shall go to the ken and fetch it, to make all\\r , sure; and I\\'ll lie down and have a snooze while she\\'s gone.\\'\\r , \\r , After a great deal of haggling and squabbling, Fagin beat down the\\r , amount of the required advance from five pounds to three pounds four\\r , and sixpence: protesting with many solemn asseverations that that would\\r , only leave him eighteen-pence to keep house with; Mr. Sikes sullenly\\r , remarking that if he couldn\\'t get any more he must accompany him home;\\r , with the Dodger and Master Bates put the eatables in the cupboard.  The\\r , Jew then, taking leave of his affectionate friend, returned homeward,\\r , attended by Nancy and the boys:  Mr. Sikes, meanwhile, flinging himself\\r , on the bed, and composing himself to sleep away the time until the\\r , young lady\\'s return.\\r , \\r , In due course, they arrived at Fagin\\'s abode, where they found Toby\\r , Crackit and Mr. Chitling intent upon their fifteenth game at cribbage,\\r , which it is scarcely necessary to say the latter gentleman lost, and\\r , with it, his fifteenth and last sixpence: much to the amusement of his\\r , young friends.  Mr. Crackit, apparently somewhat ashamed at being found\\r , relaxing himself with a gentleman so much his inferior in station and\\r , mental endowments, yawned, and inquiring after Sikes, took up his hat\\r , to go.\\r , \\r , \\'Has nobody been, Toby?\\' asked Fagin.\\r , \\r , \\'Not a living leg,\\' answered Mr. Crackit, pulling up his collar; \\'it\\'s\\r , been as dull as swipes.  You ought to stand something handsome, Fagin,\\r , to recompense me for keeping house so long. Damme, I\\'m as flat as a\\r , juryman; and should have gone to sleep, as fast as Newgate, if I hadn\\'t\\r , had the good natur\\' to amuse this youngster.  Horrid dull, I\\'m blessed\\r , if I an\\'t!\\'\\r , \\r , With these and other ejaculations of the same kind, Mr. Toby Crackit\\r , swept up his winnings, and crammed them into his waistcoat pocket with\\r , a haughty air, as though such small pieces of silver were wholly\\r , beneath the consideration of a man of his figure; this done, he\\r , swaggered out of the room, with so much elegance and gentility, that\\r , Mr. Chitling, bestowing numerous admiring glances on his legs and boots\\r , till they were out of sight, assured the company that he considered his\\r , acquaintance cheap at fifteen sixpences an interview, and that he\\r , didn\\'t value his losses the snap of his little finger.\\r , \\r , \\'Wot a rum chap you are, Tom!\\' said Master Bates, highly amused by this\\r , declaration.\\r , \\r , \\'Not a bit of it,\\' replied Mr. Chitling.  \\'Am I, Fagin?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'A very clever fellow, my dear,\\' said Fagin, patting him on the\\r , shoulder, and winking to his other pupils.\\r , \\r , \\'And Mr. Crackit is a heavy swell; an\\'t he, Fagin?\\' asked Tom.\\r , \\r , \\'No doubt at all of that, my dear.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And it is a creditable thing to have his acquaintance; an\\'t it,\\r , Fagin?\\' pursued Tom.\\r , \\r , \\'Very much so, indeed, my dear.  They\\'re only jealous, Tom, because he\\r , won\\'t give it to them.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!\\' cried Tom, triumphantly, \\'that\\'s where it is!  He has cleaned me\\r , out.  But I can go and earn some more, when I like; can\\'t I, Fagin?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'To be sure you can, and the sooner you go the better, Tom; so make up\\r , your loss at once, and don\\'t lose any more time.  Dodger! Charley!\\r , It\\'s time you were on the lay.  Come!  It\\'s near ten, and nothing done\\r , yet.\\'\\r , \\r , In obedience to this hint, the boys, nodding to Nancy, took up their\\r , hats, and left the room; the Dodger and his vivacious friend indulging,\\r , as they went, in many witticisms at the expense of Mr. Chitling; in\\r , whose conduct, it is but justice to say, there was nothing very\\r , conspicuous or peculiar:  inasmuch as there are a great number of\\r , spirited young bloods upon town, who pay a much higher price than Mr.\\r , Chitling for being seen in good society:  and a great number of fine\\r , gentlemen (composing the good society aforesaid) who established their\\r , reputation upon very much the same footing as flash Toby Crackit.\\r , \\r , \\'Now,\\' said Fagin, when they had left the room, \\'I\\'ll go and get you\\r , that cash, Nancy.  This is only the key of a little cupboard where I\\r , keep a few odd things the boys get, my dear.  I never lock up my money,\\r , for I\\'ve got none to lock up, my dear--ha! ha! ha!--none to lock up.\\r , It\\'s a poor trade, Nancy, and no thanks; but I\\'m fond of seeing the\\r , young people about me; and I bear it all, I bear it all.  Hush!\\' he\\r , said, hastily concealing the key in his breast; \\'who\\'s that?  Listen!\\'\\r , \\r , The girl, who was sitting at the table with her arms folded, appeared\\r , in no way interested in the arrival: or to care whether the person,\\r , whoever he was, came or went:  until the murmur of a man\\'s voice\\r , reached her ears.  The instant she caught the sound, she tore off her\\r , bonnet and shawl, with the rapidity of lightning, and thrust them under\\r , the table. The Jew, turning round immediately afterwards, she muttered\\r , a complaint of the heat:  in a tone of languor that contrasted, very\\r , remarkably, with the extreme haste and violence of this action:  which,\\r , however, had been unobserved by Fagin, who had his back towards her at\\r , the time.\\r , \\r , \\'Bah!\\' he whispered, as though nettled by the interruption; \\'it\\'s the\\r , man I expected before; he\\'s coming downstairs.  Not a word about the\\r , money while he\\'s here, Nance.  He won\\'t stop long.  Not ten minutes, my\\r , dear.\\'\\r , \\r , Laying his skinny forefinger upon his lip, the Jew carried a candle to\\r , the door, as a man\\'s step was heard upon the stairs without.  He\\r , reached it, at the same moment as the visitor, who, coming hastily into\\r , the room, was close upon the girl before he observed her.\\r , \\r , It was Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'Only one of my young people,\\' said Fagin, observing that Monks drew\\r , back, on beholding a stranger.  \\'Don\\'t move, Nancy.\\'\\r , \\r , The girl drew closer to the table, and glancing at Monks with an air of\\r , careless levity, withdrew her eyes; but as he turned towards Fagin, she\\r , stole another look; so keen and searching, and full of purpose, that if\\r , there had been any bystander to observe the change, he could hardly\\r , have believed the two looks to have proceeded from the same person.\\r , \\r , \\'Any news?\\' inquired Fagin.\\r , \\r , \\'Great.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And--and--good?\\' asked Fagin, hesitating as though he feared to vex\\r , the other man by being too sanguine.\\r , \\r , \\'Not bad, any way,\\' replied Monks with a smile.  \\'I have been prompt\\r , enough this time.  Let me have a word with you.\\'\\r , \\r , The girl drew closer to the table, and made no offer to leave the room,\\r , although she could see that Monks was pointing to her.  The Jew:\\r , perhaps fearing she might say something aloud about the money, if he\\r , endeavoured to get rid of her:  pointed upward, and took Monks out of\\r , the room.\\r , \\r , \\'Not that infernal hole we were in before,\\' she could hear the man say\\r , as they went upstairs.  Fagin laughed; and making some reply which did\\r , not reach her, seemed, by the creaking of the boards, to lead his\\r , companion to the second story.\\r , \\r , Before the sound of their footsteps had ceased to echo through the\\r , house, the girl had slipped off her shoes; and drawing her gown loosely\\r , over her head, and muffling her arms in it, stood at the door,\\r , listening with breathless interest.  The moment the noise ceased, she\\r , glided from the room; ascended the stairs with incredible softness and\\r , silence; and was lost in the gloom above.\\r , \\r , The room remained deserted for a quarter of an hour or more; the girl\\r , glided back with the same unearthly tread; and, immediately afterwards,\\r , the two men were heard descending.  Monks went at once into the street;\\r , and the Jew crawled upstairs again for the money.  When he returned,\\r , the girl was adjusting her shawl and bonnet, as if preparing to be gone.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, Nance!\\' exclaimed the Jew, starting back as he put down the\\r , candle, \\'how pale you are!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Pale!\\' echoed the girl, shading her eyes with her hands, as if to look\\r , steadily at him.\\r , \\r , \\'Quite horrible.  What have you been doing to yourself?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing that I know of, except sitting in this close place for I don\\'t\\r , know how long and all,\\' replied the girl carelessly. \\'Come!  Let me get\\r , back; that\\'s a dear.\\'\\r , \\r , With a sigh for every piece of money, Fagin told the amount into her\\r , hand.  They parted without more conversation, merely interchanging a\\r , \\'good-night.\\'\\r , \\r , When the girl got into the open street, she sat down upon a doorstep;\\r , and seemed, for a few moments, wholly bewildered and unable to pursue\\r , her way.  Suddenly she arose; and hurrying on, in a direction quite\\r , opposite to that in which Sikes was awaiting her returned, quickened\\r , her pace, until it gradually resolved into a violent run.  After\\r , completely exhausting herself, she stopped to take breath:  and, as if\\r , suddenly recollecting herself, and deploring her inability to do\\r , something she was bent upon, wrung her hands, and burst into tears.\\r , \\r , It might be that her tears relieved her, or that she felt the full\\r , hopelessness of her condition; but she turned back; and hurrying with\\r , nearly as great rapidity in the contrary direction; partly to recover\\r , lost time, and partly to keep pace with the violent current of her own\\r , thoughts:  soon reached the dwelling where she had left the\\r , housebreaker.\\r , \\r , If she betrayed any agitation, when she presented herself to Mr. Sikes,\\r , he did not observe it; for merely inquiring if she had brought the\\r , money, and receiving a reply in the affirmative, he uttered a growl of\\r , satisfaction, and replacing his head upon the pillow, resumed the\\r , slumbers which her arrival had interrupted.\\r , \\r , It was fortunate for her that the possession of money occasioned him so\\r , much employment next day in the way of eating and drinking; and withal\\r , had so beneficial an effect in smoothing down the asperities of his\\r , temper; that he had neither time nor inclination to be very critical\\r , upon her behaviour and deportment.  That she had all the abstracted and\\r , nervous manner of one who is on the eve of some bold and hazardous\\r , step, which it has required no common struggle to resolve upon, would\\r , have been obvious to the lynx-eyed Fagin, who would most probably have\\r , taken the alarm at once; but Mr. Sikes lacking the niceties of\\r , discrimination, and being troubled with no more subtle misgivings than\\r , those which resolve themselves into a dogged roughness of behaviour\\r , towards everybody; and being, furthermore, in an unusually amiable\\r , condition, as has been already observed; saw nothing unusual in her\\r , demeanor, and indeed, troubled himself so little about her, that, had\\r , her agitation been far more perceptible than it was, it would have been\\r , very unlikely to have awakened his suspicions.\\r , \\r , As that day closed in, the girl\\'s excitement increased; and, when night\\r , came on, and she sat by, watching until the housebreaker should drink\\r , himself asleep, there was an unusual paleness in her cheek, and a fire\\r , in her eye, that even Sikes observed with astonishment.\\r , \\r , Mr. Sikes being weak from the fever, was lying in bed, taking hot water\\r , with his gin to render it less inflammatory; and had pushed his glass\\r , towards Nancy to be replenished for the third or fourth time, when\\r , these symptoms first struck him.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, burn my body!\\' said the man, raising himself on his hands as he\\r , stared the girl in the face.  \\'You look like a corpse come to life\\r , again.  What\\'s the matter?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Matter!\\' replied the girl.  \\'Nothing.  What do you look at me so hard\\r , for?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What foolery is this?\\' demanded Sikes, grasping her by the arm, and\\r , shaking her roughly.  \\'What is it?  What do you mean?  What are you\\r , thinking of?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Of many things, Bill,\\' replied the girl, shivering, and as she did so,\\r , pressing her hands upon her eyes.  \\'But, Lord!  What odds in that?\\'\\r , \\r , The tone of forced gaiety in which the last words were spoken, seemed\\r , to produce a deeper impression on Sikes than the wild and rigid look\\r , which had preceded them.\\r , \\r , \\'I tell you wot it is,\\' said Sikes; \\'if you haven\\'t caught the fever,\\r , and got it comin\\' on, now, there\\'s something more than usual in the\\r , wind, and something dangerous too.  You\\'re not a-going to--.  No,\\r , damme! you wouldn\\'t do that!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Do what?\\' asked the girl.\\r , \\r , \\'There ain\\'t,\\' said Sikes, fixing his eyes upon her, and muttering the\\r , words to himself; \\'there ain\\'t a stauncher-hearted gal going, or I\\'d\\r , have cut her throat three months ago.  She\\'s got the fever coming on;\\r , that\\'s it.\\'\\r , \\r , Fortifying himself with this assurance, Sikes drained the glass to the\\r , bottom, and then, with many grumbling oaths, called for his physic.\\r , The girl jumped up, with great alacrity; poured it quickly out, but\\r , with her back towards him; and held the vessel to his lips, while he\\r , drank off the contents.\\r , \\r , \\'Now,\\' said the robber, \\'come and sit aside of me, and put on your own\\r , face; or I\\'ll alter it so, that you won\\'t know it agin when you do want\\r , it.\\'\\r , \\r , The girl obeyed.  Sikes, locking her hand in his, fell back upon the\\r , pillow: turning his eyes upon her face.  They closed; opened again;\\r , closed once more; again opened.  He shifted his position restlessly;\\r , and, after dozing again, and again, for two or three minutes, and as\\r , often springing up with a look of terror, and gazing vacantly about\\r , him, was suddenly stricken, as it were, while in the very attitude of\\r , rising, into a deep and heavy sleep.  The grasp of his hand relaxed;\\r , the upraised arm fell languidly by his side; and he lay like one in a\\r , profound trance.\\r , \\r , \\'The laudanum has taken effect at last,\\' murmured the girl, as she rose\\r , from the bedside.  \\'I may be too late, even now.\\'\\r , \\r , She hastily dressed herself in her bonnet and shawl:  looking fearfully\\r , round, from time to time, as if, despite the sleeping draught, she\\r , expected every moment to feel the pressure of Sikes\\'s heavy hand upon\\r , her shoulder; then, stooping softly over the bed, she kissed the\\r , robber\\'s lips; and then opening and closing the room-door with\\r , noiseless touch, hurried from the house.\\r , \\r , A watchman was crying half-past nine, down a dark passage through which\\r , she had to pass, in gaining the main thoroughfare.\\r , \\r , \\'Has it long gone the half-hour?\\' asked the girl.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'ll strike the hour in another quarter,\\' said the man: raising his\\r , lantern to her face.\\r , \\r , \\'And I cannot get there in less than an hour or more,\\' muttered Nancy:\\r , brushing swiftly past him, and gliding rapidly down the street.\\r , \\r , Many of the shops were already closing in the back lanes and avenues\\r , through which she tracked her way, in making from Spitalfields towards\\r , the West-End of London.  The clock struck ten, increasing her\\r , impatience.  She tore along the narrow pavement:  elbowing the\\r , passengers from side to side; and darting almost under the horses\\'\\r , heads, crossed crowded streets, where clusters of persons were eagerly\\r , watching their opportunity to do the like.\\r , \\r , \\'The woman is mad!\\' said the people, turning to look after her as she\\r , rushed away.\\r , \\r , When she reached the more wealthy quarter of the town, the streets were\\r , comparatively deserted; and here her headlong progress excited a still\\r , greater curiosity in the stragglers whom she hurried past.  Some\\r , quickened their pace behind, as though to see whither she was hastening\\r , at such an unusual rate; and a few made head upon her, and looked back,\\r , surprised at her undiminished speed; but they fell off one by one; and\\r , when she neared her place of destination, she was alone.\\r , \\r , It was a family hotel in a quiet but handsome street near Hyde Park.\\r , As the brilliant light of the lamp which burnt before its door, guided\\r , her to the spot, the clock struck eleven.  She had loitered for a few\\r , paces as though irresolute, and making up her mind to advance; but the\\r , sound determined her, and she stepped into the hall.  The porter\\'s seat\\r , was vacant.  She looked round with an air of incertitude, and advanced\\r , towards the stairs.\\r , \\r , \\'Now, young woman!\\' said a smartly-dressed female, looking out from a\\r , door behind her, \\'who do you want here?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'A lady who is stopping in this house,\\' answered the girl.\\r , \\r , \\'A lady!\\' was the reply, accompanied with a scornful look. \\'What lady?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Miss Maylie,\\' said Nancy.\\r , \\r , The young woman, who had by this time, noted her appearance, replied\\r , only by a look of virtuous disdain; and summoned a man to answer her.\\r , To him, Nancy repeated her request.\\r , \\r , \\'What name am I to say?\\' asked the waiter.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s of no use saying any,\\' replied Nancy.\\r , \\r , \\'Nor business?\\' said the man.\\r , \\r , \\'No, nor that neither,\\' rejoined the girl.  \\'I must see the lady.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Come!\\' said the man, pushing her towards the door.  \\'None of this.\\r , Take yourself off.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I shall be carried out if I go!\\' said the girl violently; \\'and I can\\r , make that a job that two of you won\\'t like to do.  Isn\\'t there anybody\\r , here,\\' she said, looking round, \\'that will see a simple message carried\\r , for a poor wretch like me?\\'\\r , \\r , This appeal produced an effect on a good-tempered-faced man-cook, who\\r , with some of the other servants was looking on, and who stepped forward\\r , to interfere.\\r , \\r , \\'Take it up for her, Joe; can\\'t you?\\' said this person.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s the good?\\' replied the man.  \\'You don\\'t suppose the young lady\\r , will see such as her; do you?\\'\\r , \\r , This allusion to Nancy\\'s doubtful character, raised a vast quantity of\\r , chaste wrath in the bosoms of four housemaids, who remarked, with great\\r , fervour, that the creature was a disgrace to her sex; and strongly\\r , advocated her being thrown, ruthlessly, into the kennel.\\r , \\r , \\'Do what you like with me,\\' said the girl, turning to the men again;\\r , \\'but do what I ask you first, and I ask you to give this message for\\r , God Almighty\\'s sake.\\'\\r , \\r , The soft-hearted cook added his intercession, and the result was that\\r , the man who had first appeared undertook its delivery.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s it to be?\\' said the man, with one foot on the stairs.\\r , \\r , \\'That a young woman earnestly asks to speak to Miss Maylie alone,\\' said\\r , Nancy; \\'and that if the lady will only hear the first word she has to\\r , say, she will know whether to hear her business, or to have her turned\\r , out of doors as an impostor.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I say,\\' said the man, \\'you\\'re coming it strong!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You give the message,\\' said the girl firmly; \\'and let me hear the\\r , answer.\\'\\r , \\r , The man ran upstairs.  Nancy remained, pale and almost breathless,\\r , listening with quivering lip to the very audible expressions of scorn,\\r , of which the chaste housemaids were very prolific; and of which they\\r , became still more so, when the man returned, and said the young woman\\r , was to walk upstairs.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s no good being proper in this world,\\' said the first housemaid.\\r , \\r , \\'Brass can do better than the gold what has stood the fire,\\' said the\\r , second.\\r , \\r , The third contented herself with wondering \\'what ladies was made of\\';\\r , and the fourth took the first in a quartette of \\'Shameful!\\' with which\\r , the Dianas concluded.\\r , \\r , Regardless of all this: for she had weightier matters at heart: Nancy\\r , followed the man, with trembling limbs, to a small ante-chamber,\\r , lighted by a lamp from the ceiling. Here he left her, and retired.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XL\\r , \\r , A STRANGE INTERVIEW, WHICH IS A SEQUEL TO THE LAST CHAMBER\\r , \\r , The girl\\'s life had been squandered in the streets, and among the most\\r , noisome of the stews and dens of London, but there was something of the\\r , woman\\'s original nature left in her still; and when she heard a light\\r , step approaching the door opposite to that by which she had entered,\\r , and thought of the wide contrast which the small room would in another\\r , moment contain, she felt burdened with the sense of her own deep shame,\\r , and shrunk as though she could scarcely bear the presence of her with\\r , whom she had sought this interview.\\r , \\r , But struggling with these better feelings was pride,--the vice of the\\r , lowest and most debased creatures no less than of the high and\\r , self-assured.  The miserable companion of thieves and ruffians, the\\r , fallen outcast of low haunts, the associate of the scourings of the\\r , jails and hulks, living within the shadow of the gallows itself,--even\\r , this degraded being felt too proud to betray a feeble gleam of the\\r , womanly feeling which she thought a weakness, but which alone connected\\r , her with that humanity, of which her wasting life had obliterated so\\r , many, many traces when a very child.\\r , \\r , She raised her eyes sufficiently to observe that the figure which\\r , presented itself was that of a slight and beautiful girl; then, bending\\r , them on the ground, she tossed her head with affected carelessness as\\r , she said:\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s a hard matter to get to see you, lady.  If I had taken offence,\\r , and gone away, as many would have done, you\\'d have been sorry for it\\r , one day, and not without reason either.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I am very sorry if any one has behaved harshly to you,\\' replied Rose.\\r , \\'Do not think of that.  Tell me why you wished to see me. I am the\\r , person you inquired for.\\'\\r , \\r , The kind tone of this answer, the sweet voice, the gentle manner, the\\r , absence of any accent of haughtiness or displeasure, took the girl\\r , completely by surprise, and she burst into tears.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, lady, lady!\\' she said, clasping her hands passionately before her\\r , face, \\'if there was more like you, there would be fewer like me,--there\\r , would--there would!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Sit down,\\' said Rose, earnestly.  \\'If you are in poverty or affliction\\r , I shall be truly glad to relieve you if I can,--I shall indeed.  Sit\\r , down.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Let me stand, lady,\\' said the girl, still weeping, \\'and do not speak\\r , to me so kindly till you know me better.  It is growing late.\\r , Is--is--that door shut?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' said Rose, recoiling a few steps, as if to be nearer assistance\\r , in case she should require it.  \\'Why?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Because,\\' said the girl, \\'I am about to put my life and the lives of\\r , others in your hands.  I am the girl that dragged little Oliver back to\\r , old Fagin\\'s on the night he went out from the house in Pentonville.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You!\\' said Rose Maylie.\\r , \\r , \\'I, lady!\\' replied the girl.  \\'I am the infamous creature you have\\r , heard of, that lives among the thieves, and that never from the first\\r , moment I can recollect my eyes and senses opening on London streets\\r , have known any better life, or kinder words than they have given me, so\\r , help me God!  Do not mind shrinking openly from me, lady.  I am younger\\r , than you would think, to look at me, but I am well used to it. The\\r , poorest women fall back, as I make my way along the crowded pavement.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What dreadful things are these!\\' said Rose, involuntarily falling from\\r , her strange companion.\\r , \\r , \\'Thank Heaven upon your knees, dear lady,\\' cried the girl, \\'that you\\r , had friends to care for and keep you in your childhood, and that you\\r , were never in the midst of cold and hunger, and riot and drunkenness,\\r , and--and--something worse than all--as I have been from my cradle.  I\\r , may use the word, for the alley and the gutter were mine, as they will\\r , be my deathbed.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I pity you!\\' said Rose, in a broken voice.  \\'It wrings my heart to\\r , hear you!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Heaven bless you for your goodness!\\' rejoined the girl. \\'If you knew\\r , what I am sometimes, you would pity me, indeed. But I have stolen away\\r , from those who would surely murder me, if they knew I had been here, to\\r , tell you what I have overheard.  Do you know a man named Monks?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' said Rose.\\r , \\r , \\'He knows you,\\' replied the girl; \\'and knew you were here, for it was\\r , by hearing him tell the place that I found you out.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I never heard the name,\\' said Rose.\\r , \\r , \\'Then he goes by some other amongst us,\\' rejoined the girl, \\'which I\\r , more than thought before.  Some time ago, and soon after Oliver was put\\r , into your house on the night of the robbery, I--suspecting this\\r , man--listened to a conversation held between him and Fagin in the dark.\\r , I found out, from what I heard, that Monks--the man I asked you about,\\r , you know--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' said Rose, \\'I understand.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'--That Monks,\\' pursued the girl, \\'had seen him accidently with two of\\r , our boys on the day we first lost him, and had known him directly to be\\r , the same child that he was watching for, though I couldn\\'t make out\\r , why.  A bargain was struck with Fagin, that if Oliver was got back he\\r , should have a certain sum; and he was to have more for making him a\\r , thief, which this Monks wanted for some purpose of his own.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'For what purpose?\\' asked Rose.\\r , \\r , \\'He caught sight of my shadow on the wall as I listened, in the hope of\\r , finding out,\\' said the girl; \\'and there are not many people besides me\\r , that could have got out of their way in time to escape discovery.  But\\r , I did; and I saw him no more till last night.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And what occurred then?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ll tell you, lady.  Last night he came again.  Again they went\\r , upstairs, and I, wrapping myself up so that my shadow would not betray\\r , me, again listened at the door.  The first words I heard Monks say were\\r , these:  \"So the only proofs of the boy\\'s identity lie at the bottom of\\r , the river, and the old hag that received them from the mother is\\r , rotting in her coffin.\"  They laughed, and talked of his success in\\r , doing this; and Monks, talking on about the boy, and getting very wild,\\r , said that though he had got the young devil\\'s money safely now, he\\'d\\r , rather have had it the other way; for, what a game it would have been\\r , to have brought down the boast of the father\\'s will, by driving him\\r , through every jail in town, and then hauling him up for some capital\\r , felony which Fagin could easily manage, after having made a good profit\\r , of him besides.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What is all this!\\' said Rose.\\r , \\r , \\'The truth, lady, though it comes from my lips,\\' replied the girl.\\r , \\'Then, he said, with oaths common enough in my ears, but strange to\\r , yours, that if he could gratify his hatred by taking the boy\\'s life\\r , without bringing his own neck in danger, he would; but, as he couldn\\'t,\\r , he\\'d be upon the watch to meet him at every turn in life; and if he\\r , took advantage of his birth and history, he might harm him yet. \"In\\r , short, Fagin,\" he says, \"Jew as you are, you never laid such snares as\\r , I\\'ll contrive for my young brother, Oliver.\"\\'\\r , \\r , \\'His brother!\\' exclaimed Rose.\\r , \\r , \\'Those were his words,\\' said Nancy, glancing uneasily round, as she had\\r , scarcely ceased to do, since she began to speak, for a vision of Sikes\\r , haunted her perpetually.  \\'And more. When he spoke of you and the other\\r , lady, and said it seemed contrived by Heaven, or the devil, against\\r , him, that Oliver should come into your hands, he laughed, and said\\r , there was some comfort in that too, for how many thousands and hundreds\\r , of thousands of pounds would you not give, if you had them, to know who\\r , your two-legged spaniel was.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You do not mean,\\' said Rose, turning very pale, \\'to tell me that this\\r , was said in earnest?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He spoke in hard and angry earnest, if a man ever did,\\' replied the\\r , girl, shaking her head.  \\'He is an earnest man when his hatred is up.\\r , I know many who do worse things; but I\\'d rather listen to them all a\\r , dozen times, than to that Monks once.  It is growing late, and I have\\r , to reach home without suspicion of having been on such an errand as\\r , this.  I must get back quickly.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'But what can I do?\\' said Rose.  \\'To what use can I turn this\\r , communication without you?  Back!  Why do you wish to return to\\r , companions you paint in such terrible colors?  If you repeat this\\r , information to a gentleman whom I can summon in an instant from the\\r , next room, you can be consigned to some place of safety without half an\\r , hour\\'s delay.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I wish to go back,\\' said the girl.  \\'I must go back, because--how can\\r , I tell such things to an innocent lady like you?--because among the men\\r , I have told you of, there is one: the most desperate among them all;\\r , that I can\\'t leave:  no, not even to be saved from the life I am\\r , leading now.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Your having interfered in this dear boy\\'s behalf before,\\' said Rose;\\r , \\'your coming here, at so great a risk, to tell me what you have heard;\\r , your manner, which convinces me of the truth of what you say; your\\r , evident contrition, and sense of shame; all lead me to believe that you\\r , might yet be reclaimed.  Oh!\\' said the earnest girl, folding her hands\\r , as the tears coursed down her face, \\'do not turn a deaf ear to the\\r , entreaties of one of your own sex; the first--the first, I do believe,\\r , who ever appealed to you in the voice of pity and compassion.  Do hear\\r , my words, and let me save you yet, for better things.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Lady,\\' cried the girl, sinking on her knees, \\'dear, sweet, angel lady,\\r , you _are_ the first that ever blessed me with such words as these, and\\r , if I had heard them years ago, they might have turned me from a life of\\r , sin and sorrow; but it is too late, it is too late!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It is never too late,\\' said Rose, \\'for penitence and atonement.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It is,\\' cried the girl, writhing in agony of her mind; \\'I cannot leave\\r , him now!  I could not be his death.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why should you be?\\' asked Rose.\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing could save him,\\' cried the girl.  \\'If I told others what I\\r , have told you, and led to their being taken, he would be sure to die.\\r , He is the boldest, and has been so cruel!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Is it possible,\\' cried Rose, \\'that for such a man as this, you can\\r , resign every future hope, and the certainty of immediate rescue?  It is\\r , madness.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t know what it is,\\' answered the girl; \\'I only know that it is\\r , so, and not with me alone, but with hundreds of others as bad and\\r , wretched as myself.  I must go back.  Whether it is God\\'s wrath for the\\r , wrong I have done, I do not know; but I am drawn back to him through\\r , every suffering and ill usage; and I should be, I believe, if I knew\\r , that I was to die by his hand at last.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What am I to do?\\' said Rose.  \\'I should not let you depart from me\\r , thus.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You should, lady, and I know you will,\\' rejoined the girl, rising.\\r , \\'You will not stop my going because I have trusted in your goodness,\\r , and forced no promise from you, as I might have done.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Of what use, then, is the communication you have made?\\' said Rose.\\r , \\'This mystery must be investigated, or how will its disclosure to me,\\r , benefit Oliver, whom you are anxious to serve?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You must have some kind gentleman about you that will hear it as a\\r , secret, and advise you what to do,\\' rejoined the girl.\\r , \\r , \\'But where can I find you again when it is necessary?\\' asked Rose.  \\'I\\r , do not seek to know where these dreadful people live, but where will\\r , you be walking or passing at any settled period from this time?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Will you promise me that you will have my secret strictly kept, and\\r , come alone, or with the only other person that knows it; and that I\\r , shall not be watched or followed?\\' asked the girl.\\r , \\r , \\'I promise you solemnly,\\' answered Rose.\\r , \\r , \\'Every Sunday night, from eleven until the clock strikes twelve,\\' said\\r , the girl without hesitation, \\'I will walk on London Bridge if I am\\r , alive.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Stay another moment,\\' interposed Rose, as the girl moved hurriedly\\r , towards the door.  \\'Think once again on your own condition, and the\\r , opportunity you have of escaping from it.  You have a claim on me:  not\\r , only as the voluntary bearer of this intelligence, but as a woman lost\\r , almost beyond redemption.  Will you return to this gang of robbers, and\\r , to this man, when a word can save you?  What fascination is it that can\\r , take you back, and make you cling to wickedness and misery?  Oh! is\\r , there no chord in your heart that I can touch!  Is there nothing left,\\r , to which I can appeal against this terrible infatuation!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'When ladies as young, and good, and beautiful as you are,\\' replied the\\r , girl steadily, \\'give away your hearts, love will carry you all\\r , lengths--even such as you, who have home, friends, other admirers,\\r , everything, to fill them.  When such as I, who have no certain roof but\\r , the coffinlid, and no friend in sickness or death but the hospital\\r , nurse, set our rotten hearts on any man, and let him fill the place\\r , that has been a blank through all our wretched lives, who can hope to\\r , cure us?  Pity us, lady--pity us for having only one feeling of the\\r , woman left, and for having that turned, by a heavy judgment, from a\\r , comfort and a pride, into a new means of violence and suffering.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You will,\\' said Rose, after a pause, \\'take some money from me, which\\r , may enable you to live without dishonesty--at all events until we meet\\r , again?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not a penny,\\' replied the girl, waving her hand.\\r , \\r , \\'Do not close your heart against all my efforts to help you,\\' said\\r , Rose, stepping gently forward.  \\'I wish to serve you indeed.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You would serve me best, lady,\\' replied the girl, wringing her hands,\\r , \\'if you could take my life at once; for I have felt more grief to think\\r , of what I am, to-night, than I ever did before, and it would be\\r , something not to die in the hell in which I have lived.  God bless you,\\r , sweet lady, and send as much happiness on your head as I have brought\\r , shame on mine!\\'\\r , \\r , Thus speaking, and sobbing aloud, the unhappy creature turned away;\\r , while Rose Maylie, overpowered by this extraordinary interview, which\\r , had more the semblance of a rapid dream than an actual occurrence, sank\\r , into a chair, and endeavoured to collect her wandering thoughts.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XLI\\r , \\r , CONTAINING FRESH DISCOVERIES, AND SHOWING THAT SUPRISES, LIKE\\r , MISFORTUNES, SELDOM COME ALONE\\r , \\r , Her situation was, indeed, one of no common trial and difficulty. While\\r , she felt the most eager and burning desire to penetrate the mystery in\\r , which Oliver\\'s history was enveloped, she could not but hold sacred the\\r , confidence which the miserable woman with whom she had just conversed,\\r , had reposed in her, as a young and guileless girl.  Her words and\\r , manner had touched Rose Maylie\\'s heart; and, mingled with her love for\\r , her young charge, and scarcely less intense in its truth and fervour,\\r , was her fond wish to win the outcast back to repentance and hope.\\r , \\r , They purposed remaining in London only three days, prior to departing\\r , for some weeks to a distant part of the coast.  It was now midnight of\\r , the first day.  What course of action could she determine upon, which\\r , could be adopted in eight-and-forty hours? Or how could she postpone\\r , the journey without exciting suspicion?\\r , \\r , Mr. Losberne was with them, and would be for the next two days; but\\r , Rose was too well acquainted with the excellent gentleman\\'s\\r , impetuosity, and foresaw too clearly the wrath with which, in the first\\r , explosion of his indignation, he would regard the instrument of\\r , Oliver\\'s recapture, to trust him with the secret, when her\\r , representations in the girl\\'s behalf could be seconded by no\\r , experienced person.  These were all reasons for the greatest caution\\r , and most circumspect behaviour in communicating it to Mrs. Maylie,\\r , whose first impulse would infallibly be to hold a conference with the\\r , worthy doctor on the subject.  As to resorting to any legal adviser,\\r , even if she had known how to do so, it was scarcely to be thought of,\\r , for the same reason.  Once the thought occurred to her of seeking\\r , assistance from Harry; but this awakened the recollection of their last\\r , parting, and it seemed unworthy of her to call him back, when--the\\r , tears rose to her eyes as she pursued this train of reflection--he\\r , might have by this time learnt to forget her, and to be happier away.\\r , \\r , Disturbed by these different reflections; inclining now to one course\\r , and then to another, and again recoiling from all, as each successive\\r , consideration presented itself to her mind; Rose passed a sleepless and\\r , anxious night.  After more communing with herself next day, she arrived\\r , at the desperate conclusion of consulting Harry.\\r , \\r , \\'If it be painful to him,\\' she thought, \\'to come back here, how painful\\r , it will be to me!  But perhaps he will not come; he may write, or he\\r , may come himself, and studiously abstain from meeting me--he did when\\r , he went away.  I hardly thought he would; but it was better for us\\r , both.\\'  And here Rose dropped the pen, and turned away, as though the\\r , very paper which was to be her messenger should not see her weep.\\r , \\r , She had taken up the same pen, and laid it down again fifty times, and\\r , had considered and reconsidered the first line of her letter without\\r , writing the first word, when Oliver, who had been walking in the\\r , streets, with Mr. Giles for a body-guard, entered the room in such\\r , breathless haste and violent agitation, as seemed to betoken some new\\r , cause of alarm.\\r , \\r , \\'What makes you look so flurried?\\' asked Rose, advancing to meet him.\\r , \\r , \\'I hardly know how; I feel as if I should be choked,\\' replied the boy.\\r , \\'Oh dear!  To think that I should see him at last, and you should be\\r , able to know that I have told you the truth!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I never thought you had told us anything but the truth,\\' said Rose,\\r , soothing him.  \\'But what is this?--of whom do you speak?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I have seen the gentleman,\\' replied Oliver, scarcely able to\\r , articulate, \\'the gentleman who was so good to me--Mr. Brownlow, that we\\r , have so often talked about.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Where?\\' asked Rose.\\r , \\r , \\'Getting out of a coach,\\' replied Oliver, shedding tears of delight,\\r , \\'and going into a house.  I didn\\'t speak to him--I couldn\\'t speak to\\r , him, for he didn\\'t see me, and I trembled so, that I was not able to go\\r , up to him.  But Giles asked, for me, whether he lived there, and they\\r , said he did.  Look here,\\' said Oliver, opening a scrap of paper, \\'here\\r , it is; here\\'s where he lives--I\\'m going there directly!  Oh, dear me,\\r , dear me!  What shall I do when I come to see him and hear him speak\\r , again!\\'\\r , \\r , With her attention not a little distracted by these and a great many\\r , other incoherent exclamations of joy, Rose read the address, which was\\r , Craven Street, in the Strand.  She very soon determined upon turning\\r , the discovery to account.\\r , \\r , \\'Quick!\\' she said.  \\'Tell them to fetch a hackney-coach, and be ready\\r , to go with me.  I will take you there directly, without a minute\\'s loss\\r , of time.  I will only tell my aunt that we are going out for an hour,\\r , and be ready as soon as you are.\\'\\r , \\r , Oliver needed no prompting to despatch, and in little more than five\\r , minutes they were on their way to Craven Street.  When they arrived\\r , there, Rose left Oliver in the coach, under pretence of preparing the\\r , old gentleman to receive him; and sending up her card by the servant,\\r , requested to see Mr. Brownlow on very pressing business.  The servant\\r , soon returned, to beg that she would walk upstairs; and following him\\r , into an upper room, Miss Maylie was presented to an elderly gentleman\\r , of benevolent appearance, in a bottle-green coat.  At no great distance\\r , from whom, was seated another old gentleman, in nankeen breeches and\\r , gaiters; who did not look particularly benevolent, and who was sitting\\r , with his hands clasped on the top of a thick stick, and his chin\\r , propped thereupon.\\r , \\r , \\'Dear me,\\' said the gentleman, in the bottle-green coat, hastily rising\\r , with great politeness, \\'I beg your pardon, young lady--I imagined it\\r , was some importunate person who--I beg you will excuse me.  Be seated,\\r , pray.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Mr. Brownlow, I believe, sir?\\' said Rose, glancing from the other\\r , gentleman to the one who had spoken.\\r , \\r , \\'That is my name,\\' said the old gentleman.  \\'This is my friend, Mr.\\r , Grimwig.  Grimwig, will you leave us for a few minutes?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I believe,\\' interposed Miss Maylie, \\'that at this period of our\\r , interview, I need not give that gentleman the trouble of going away.\\r , If I am correctly informed, he is cognizant of the business on which I\\r , wish to speak to you.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Brownlow inclined his head.  Mr. Grimwig, who had made one very\\r , stiff bow, and risen from his chair, made another very stiff bow, and\\r , dropped into it again.\\r , \\r , \\'I shall surprise you very much, I have no doubt,\\' said Rose, naturally\\r , embarrassed; \\'but you once showed great benevolence and goodness to a\\r , very dear young friend of mine, and I am sure you will take an interest\\r , in hearing of him again.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Indeed!\\' said Mr. Brownlow.\\r , \\r , \\'Oliver Twist you knew him as,\\' replied Rose.\\r , \\r , The words no sooner escaped her lips, than Mr. Grimwig, who had been\\r , affecting to dip into a large book that lay on the table, upset it with\\r , a great crash, and falling back in his chair, discharged from his\\r , features every expression but one of unmitigated wonder, and indulged\\r , in a prolonged and vacant stare; then, as if ashamed of having betrayed\\r , so much emotion, he jerked himself, as it were, by a convulsion into\\r , his former attitude, and looking out straight before him emitted a long\\r , deep whistle, which seemed, at last, not to be discharged on empty air,\\r , but to die away in the innermost recesses of his stomach.\\r , \\r , Mr. Browlow was no less surprised, although his astonishment was not\\r , expressed in the same eccentric manner.  He drew his chair nearer to\\r , Miss Maylie\\'s, and said,\\r , \\r , \\'Do me the favour, my dear young lady, to leave entirely out of the\\r , question that goodness and benevolence of which you speak, and of which\\r , nobody else knows anything; and if you have it in your power to produce\\r , any evidence which will alter the unfavourable opinion I was once\\r , induced to entertain of that poor child, in Heaven\\'s name put me in\\r , possession of it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'A bad one!  I\\'ll eat my head if he is not a bad one,\\' growled Mr.\\r , Grimwig, speaking by some ventriloquial power, without moving a muscle\\r , of his face.\\r , \\r , \\'He is a child of a noble nature and a warm heart,\\' said Rose,\\r , colouring; \\'and that Power which has thought fit to try him beyond his\\r , years, has planted in his breast affections and feelings which would do\\r , honour to many who have numbered his days six times over.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'m only sixty-one,\\' said Mr. Grimwig, with the same rigid face. \\'And,\\r , as the devil\\'s in it if this Oliver is not twelve years old at least, I\\r , don\\'t see the application of that remark.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Do not heed my friend, Miss Maylie,\\' said Mr. Brownlow; \\'he does not\\r , mean what he says.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, he does,\\' growled Mr. Grimwig.\\r , \\r , \\'No, he does not,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, obviously rising in wrath as he\\r , spoke.\\r , \\r , \\'He\\'ll eat his head, if he doesn\\'t,\\' growled Mr. Grimwig.\\r , \\r , \\'He would deserve to have it knocked off, if he does,\\' said Mr.\\r , Brownlow.\\r , \\r , \\'And he\\'d uncommonly like to see any man offer to do it,\\' responded Mr.\\r , Grimwig, knocking his stick upon the floor.\\r , \\r , Having gone thus far, the two old gentlemen severally took snuff, and\\r , afterwards shook hands, according to their invariable custom.\\r , \\r , \\'Now, Miss Maylie,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, \\'to return to the subject in\\r , which your humanity is so much interested.  Will you let me know what\\r , intelligence you have of this poor child:  allowing me to promise that\\r , I exhausted every means in my power of discovering him, and that since\\r , I have been absent from this country, my first impression that he had\\r , imposed upon me, and had been persuaded by his former associates to rob\\r , me, has been considerably shaken.\\'\\r , \\r , Rose, who had had time to collect her thoughts, at once related, in a\\r , few natural words, all that had befallen Oliver since he left Mr.\\r , Brownlow\\'s house; reserving Nancy\\'s information for that gentleman\\'s\\r , private ear, and concluding with the assurance that his only sorrow,\\r , for some months past, had been not being able to meet with his former\\r , benefactor and friend.\\r , \\r , \\'Thank God!\\' said the old gentleman.  \\'This is great happiness to me,\\r , great happiness.  But you have not told me where he is now, Miss\\r , Maylie.  You must pardon my finding fault with you,--but why not have\\r , brought him?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He is waiting in a coach at the door,\\' replied Rose.\\r , \\r , \\'At this door!\\' cried the old gentleman.  With which he hurried out of\\r , the room, down the stairs, up the coachsteps, and into the coach,\\r , without another word.\\r , \\r , When the room-door closed behind him, Mr. Grimwig lifted up his head,\\r , and converting one of the hind legs of his chair into a pivot,\\r , described three distinct circles with the assistance of his stick and\\r , the table; sitting in it all the time.  After performing this\\r , evolution, he rose and limped as fast as he could up and down the room\\r , at least a dozen times, and then stopping suddenly before Rose, kissed\\r , her without the slightest preface.\\r , \\r , \\'Hush!\\' he said, as the young lady rose in some alarm at this unusual\\r , proceeding.  \\'Don\\'t be afraid.  I\\'m old enough to be your grandfather.\\r , You\\'re a sweet girl.  I like you.  Here they are!\\'\\r , \\r , In fact, as he threw himself at one dexterous dive into his former\\r , seat, Mr. Brownlow returned, accompanied by Oliver, whom Mr. Grimwig\\r , received very graciously; and if the gratification of that moment had\\r , been the only reward for all her anxiety and care in Oliver\\'s behalf,\\r , Rose Maylie would have been well repaid.\\r , \\r , \\'There is somebody else who should not be forgotten, by the bye,\\' said\\r , Mr. Brownlow, ringing the bell.  \\'Send Mrs. Bedwin here, if you please.\\'\\r , \\r , The old housekeeper answered the summons with all dispatch; and\\r , dropping a curtsey at the door, waited for orders.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, you get blinder every day, Bedwin,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, rather\\r , testily.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, that I do, sir,\\' replied the old lady.  \\'People\\'s eyes, at my\\r , time of life, don\\'t improve with age, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I could have told you that,\\' rejoined Mr. Brownlow; \\'but put on your\\r , glasses, and see if you can\\'t find out what you were wanted for, will\\r , you?\\'\\r , \\r , The old lady began to rummage in her pocket for her spectacles. But\\r , Oliver\\'s patience was not proof against this new trial; and yielding to\\r , his first impulse, he sprang into her arms.\\r , \\r , \\'God be good to me!\\' cried the old lady, embracing him; \\'it is my\\r , innocent boy!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'My dear old nurse!\\' cried Oliver.\\r , \\r , \\'He would come back--I knew he would,\\' said the old lady, holding him\\r , in her arms.  \\'How well he looks, and how like a gentleman\\'s son he is\\r , dressed again!  Where have you been, this long, long while?  Ah! the\\r , same sweet face, but not so pale; the same soft eye, but not so sad.  I\\r , have never forgotten them or his quiet smile, but have seen them every\\r , day, side by side with those of my own dear children, dead and gone\\r , since I was a lightsome young creature.\\'  Running on thus, and now\\r , holding Oliver from her to mark how he had grown, now clasping him to\\r , her and passing her fingers fondly through his hair, the good soul\\r , laughed and wept upon his neck by turns.\\r , \\r , Leaving her and Oliver to compare notes at leisure, Mr. Brownlow led\\r , the way into another room; and there, heard from Rose a full narration\\r , of her interview with Nancy, which occasioned him no little surprise\\r , and perplexity.  Rose also explained her reasons for not confiding in\\r , her friend Mr. Losberne in the first instance.  The old gentleman\\r , considered that she had acted prudently, and readily undertook to hold\\r , solemn conference with the worthy doctor himself.  To afford him an\\r , early opportunity for the execution of this design, it was arranged\\r , that he should call at the hotel at eight o\\'clock that evening, and\\r , that in the meantime Mrs. Maylie should be cautiously informed of all\\r , that had occurred.  These preliminaries adjusted, Rose and Oliver\\r , returned home.\\r , \\r , Rose had by no means overrated the measure of the good doctor\\'s wrath.\\r , Nancy\\'s history was no sooner unfolded to him, than he poured forth a\\r , shower of mingled threats and execrations; threatened to make her the\\r , first victim of the combined ingenuity of Messrs. Blathers and Duff;\\r , and actually put on his hat preparatory to sallying forth to obtain the\\r , assistance of those worthies.  And, doubtless, he would, in this first\\r , outbreak, have carried the intention into effect without a moment\\'s\\r , consideration of the consequences, if he had not been restrained, in\\r , part, by corresponding violence on the side of Mr. Brownlow, who was\\r , himself of an irascible temperament, and party by such arguments and\\r , representations as seemed best calculated to dissuade him from his\\r , hotbrained purpose.\\r , \\r , \\'Then what the devil is to be done?\\' said the impetuous doctor, when\\r , they had rejoined the two ladies.  \\'Are we to pass a vote of thanks to\\r , all these vagabonds, male and female, and beg them to accept a hundred\\r , pounds, or so, apiece, as a trifling mark of our esteem, and some\\r , slight acknowledgment of their kindness to Oliver?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not exactly that,\\' rejoined Mr. Brownlow, laughing; \\'but we must\\r , proceed gently and with great care.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Gentleness and care,\\' exclaimed the doctor.  \\'I\\'d send them one and\\r , all to--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Never mind where,\\' interposed Mr. Brownlow.  \\'But reflect whether\\r , sending them anywhere is likely to attain the object we have in view.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What object?\\' asked the doctor.\\r , \\r , \\'Simply, the discovery of Oliver\\'s parentage, and regaining for him the\\r , inheritance of which, if this story be true, he has been fraudulently\\r , deprived.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!\\' said Mr. Losberne, cooling himself with his pocket-handkerchief;\\r , \\'I almost forgot that.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You see,\\' pursued Mr. Brownlow; \\'placing this poor girl entirely out\\r , of the question, and supposing it were possible to bring these\\r , scoundrels to justice without compromising her safety, what good should\\r , we bring about?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hanging a few of them at least, in all probability,\\' suggested the\\r , doctor, \\'and transporting the rest.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Very good,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow, smiling; \\'but no doubt they will\\r , bring that about for themselves in the fulness of time, and if we step\\r , in to forestall them, it seems to me that we shall be performing a very\\r , Quixotic act, in direct opposition to our own interest--or at least to\\r , Oliver\\'s, which is the same thing.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'How?\\' inquired the doctor.\\r , \\r , \\'Thus.  It is quite clear that we shall have extreme difficulty in\\r , getting to the bottom of this mystery, unless we can bring this man,\\r , Monks, upon his knees.  That can only be done by stratagem, and by\\r , catching him when he is not surrounded by these people.  For, suppose\\r , he were apprehended, we have no proof against him.  He is not even (so\\r , far as we know, or as the facts appear to us) concerned with the gang\\r , in any of their robberies. If he were not discharged, it is very\\r , unlikely that he could receive any further punishment than being\\r , committed to prison as a rogue and vagabond; and of course ever\\r , afterwards his mouth would be so obstinately closed that he might as\\r , well, for our purposes, be deaf, dumb, blind, and an idiot.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then,\\' said the doctor impetuously, \\'I put it to you again, whether\\r , you think it reasonable that this promise to the girl should be\\r , considered binding; a promise made with the best and kindest\\r , intentions, but really--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Do not discuss the point, my dear young lady, pray,\\' said Mr.\\r , Brownlow, interrupting Rose as she was about to speak. \\'The promise\\r , shall be kept.  I don\\'t think it will, in the slightest degree,\\r , interfere with our proceedings.  But, before we can resolve upon any\\r , precise course of action, it will be necessary to see the girl; to\\r , ascertain from her whether she will point out this Monks, on the\\r , understanding that he is to be dealt with by us, and not by the law;\\r , or, if she will not, or cannot do that, to procure from her such an\\r , account of his haunts and description of his person, as will enable us\\r , to identify him.  She cannot be seen until next Sunday night; this is\\r , Tuesday.  I would suggest that in the meantime, we remain perfectly\\r , quiet, and keep these matters secret even from Oliver himself.\\'\\r , \\r , Although Mr. Losberne received with many wry faces a proposal involving\\r , a delay of five whole days, he was fain to admit that no better course\\r , occurred to him just then; and as both Rose and Mrs. Maylie sided very\\r , strongly with Mr. Brownlow, that gentleman\\'s proposition was carried\\r , unanimously.\\r , \\r , \\'I should like,\\' he said, \\'to call in the aid of my friend Grimwig.  He\\r , is a strange creature, but a shrewd one, and might prove of material\\r , assistance to us; I should say that he was bred a lawyer, and quitted\\r , the Bar in disgust because he had only one brief and a motion of\\r , course, in twenty years, though whether that is recommendation or not,\\r , you must determine for yourselves.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I have no objection to your calling in your friend if I may call in\\r , mine,\\' said the doctor.\\r , \\r , \\'We must put it to the vote,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow, \\'who may he be?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That lady\\'s son, and this young lady\\'s--very old friend,\\' said the\\r , doctor, motioning towards Mrs. Maylie, and concluding with an\\r , expressive glance at her niece.\\r , \\r , Rose blushed deeply, but she did not make any audible objection to this\\r , motion (possibly she felt in a hopeless minority); and Harry Maylie and\\r , Mr. Grimwig were accordingly added to the committee.\\r , \\r , \\'We stay in town, of course,\\' said Mrs. Maylie, \\'while there remains\\r , the slightest prospect of prosecuting this inquiry with a chance of\\r , success.  I will spare neither trouble nor expense in behalf of the\\r , object in which we are all so deeply interested, and I am content to\\r , remain here, if it be for twelve months, so long as you assure me that\\r , any hope remains.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Good!\\' rejoined Mr. Brownlow.  \\'And as I see on the faces about me, a\\r , disposition to inquire how it happened that I was not in the way to\\r , corroborate Oliver\\'s tale, and had so suddenly left the kingdom, let me\\r , stipulate that I shall be asked no questions until such time as I may\\r , deem it expedient to forestall them by telling my own story.  Believe\\r , me, I make this request with good reason, for I might otherwise excite\\r , hopes destined never to be realised, and only increase difficulties and\\r , disappointments already quite numerous enough.  Come!  Supper has been\\r , announced, and young Oliver, who is all alone in the next room, will\\r , have begun to think, by this time, that we have wearied of his company,\\r , and entered into some dark conspiracy to thrust him forth upon the\\r , world.\\'\\r , \\r , With these words, the old gentleman gave his hand to Mrs. Maylie, and\\r , escorted her into the supper-room.  Mr. Losberne followed, leading\\r , Rose; and the council was, for the present, effectually broken up.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XLII\\r , \\r , AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE OF OLIVER\\'S, EXHIBITING DECIDED MARKS OF GENIUS,\\r , BECOMES A PUBLIC CHARACTER IN THE METROPOLIS\\r , \\r , Upon the night when Nancy, having lulled Mr. Sikes to sleep, hurried on\\r , her self-imposed mission to Rose Maylie, there advanced towards London,\\r , by the Great North Road, two persons, upon whom it is expedient that\\r , this history should bestow some attention.\\r , \\r , They were a man and woman; or perhaps they would be better described as\\r , a male and female:  for the former was one of those long-limbed,\\r , knock-kneed, shambling, bony people, to whom it is difficult to assign\\r , any precise age,--looking as they do, when they are yet boys, like\\r , undergrown men, and when they are almost men, like overgrown boys.  The\\r , woman was young, but of a robust and hardy make, as she need have been\\r , to bear the weight of the heavy bundle which was strapped to her back.\\r , Her companion was not encumbered with much luggage, as there merely\\r , dangled from a stick which he carried over his shoulder, a small parcel\\r , wrapped in a common handkerchief, and apparently light enough.  This\\r , circumstance, added to the length of his legs, which were of unusual\\r , extent, enabled him with much ease to keep some half-dozen paces in\\r , advance of his companion, to whom he occasionally turned with an\\r , impatient jerk of the head:  as if reproaching her tardiness, and\\r , urging her to greater exertion.\\r , \\r , Thus, they had toiled along the dusty road, taking little heed of any\\r , object within sight, save when they stepped aside to allow a wider\\r , passage for the mail-coaches which were whirling out of town, until\\r , they passed through Highgate archway; when the foremost traveller\\r , stopped and called impatiently to his companion,\\r , \\r , \\'Come on, can\\'t yer?  What a lazybones yer are, Charlotte.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s a heavy load, I can tell you,\\' said the female, coming up, almost\\r , breathless with fatigue.\\r , \\r , \\'Heavy!  What are yer talking about?  What are yer made for?\\' rejoined\\r , the male traveller, changing his own little bundle as he spoke, to the\\r , other shoulder.  \\'Oh, there yer are, resting again! Well, if yer ain\\'t\\r , enough to tire anybody\\'s patience out, I don\\'t know what is!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Is it much farther?\\' asked the woman, resting herself against a bank,\\r , and looking up with the perspiration streaming from her face.\\r , \\r , \\'Much farther!  Yer as good as there,\\' said the long-legged tramper,\\r , pointing out before him.  \\'Look there!  Those are the lights of London.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'They\\'re a good two mile off, at least,\\' said the woman despondingly.\\r , \\r , \\'Never mind whether they\\'re two mile off, or twenty,\\' said Noah\\r , Claypole; for he it was; \\'but get up and come on, or I\\'ll kick yer, and\\r , so I give yer notice.\\'\\r , \\r , As Noah\\'s red nose grew redder with anger, and as he crossed the road\\r , while speaking, as if fully prepared to put his threat into execution,\\r , the woman rose without any further remark, and trudged onward by his\\r , side.\\r , \\r , \\'Where do you mean to stop for the night, Noah?\\' she asked, after they\\r , had walked a few hundred yards.\\r , \\r , \\'How should I know?\\' replied Noah, whose temper had been considerably\\r , impaired by walking.\\r , \\r , \\'Near, I hope,\\' said Charlotte.\\r , \\r , \\'No, not near,\\' replied Mr. Claypole.  \\'There!  Not near; so don\\'t\\r , think it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why not?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'When I tell yer that I don\\'t mean to do a thing, that\\'s enough,\\r , without any why or because either,\\' replied Mr. Claypole with dignity.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, you needn\\'t be so cross,\\' said his companion.\\r , \\r , \\'A pretty thing it would be, wouldn\\'t it to go and stop at the very\\r , first public-house outside the town, so that Sowerberry, if he come up\\r , after us, might poke in his old nose, and have us taken back in a cart\\r , with handcuffs on,\\' said Mr. Claypole in a jeering tone.  \\'No!  I shall\\r , go and lose myself among the narrowest streets I can find, and not stop\\r , till we come to the very out-of-the-wayest house I can set eyes on.\\r , \\'Cod, yer may thanks yer stars I\\'ve got a head; for if we hadn\\'t gone,\\r , at first, the wrong road a purpose, and come back across country, yer\\'d\\r , have been locked up hard and fast a week ago, my lady.  And serve yer\\r , right for being a fool.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I know I ain\\'t as cunning as you are,\\' replied Charlotte; \\'but don\\'t\\r , put all the blame on me, and say I should have been locked up.  You\\r , would have been if I had been, any way.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yer took the money from the till, yer know yer did,\\' said Mr. Claypole.\\r , \\r , \\'I took it for you, Noah, dear,\\' rejoined Charlotte.\\r , \\r , \\'Did I keep it?\\' asked Mr. Claypole.\\r , \\r , \\'No; you trusted in me, and let me carry it like a dear, and so you\\r , are,\\' said the lady, chucking him under the chin, and drawing her arm\\r , through his.\\r , \\r , This was indeed the case; but as it was not Mr. Claypole\\'s habit to\\r , repose a blind and foolish confidence in anybody, it should be\\r , observed, in justice to that gentleman, that he had trusted Charlotte\\r , to this extent, in order that, if they were pursued, the money might be\\r , found on her:  which would leave him an opportunity of asserting his\\r , innocence of any theft, and would greatly facilitate his chances of\\r , escape.  Of course, he entered at this juncture, into no explanation of\\r , his motives, and they walked on very lovingly together.\\r , \\r , In pursuance of this cautious plan, Mr. Claypole went on, without\\r , halting, until he arrived at the Angel at Islington, where he wisely\\r , judged, from the crowd of passengers and numbers of vehicles, that\\r , London began in earnest.  Just pausing to observe which appeared the\\r , most crowded streets, and consequently the most to be avoided, he\\r , crossed into Saint John\\'s Road, and was soon deep in the obscurity of\\r , the intricate and dirty ways, which, lying between Gray\\'s Inn Lane and\\r , Smithfield, render that part of the town one of the lowest and worst\\r , that improvement has left in the midst of London.\\r , \\r , Through these streets, Noah Claypole walked, dragging Charlotte after\\r , him; now stepping into the kennel to embrace at a glance the whole\\r , external character of some small public-house; now jogging on again, as\\r , some fancied appearance induced him to believe it too public for his\\r , purpose.  At length, he stopped in front of one, more humble in\\r , appearance and more dirty than any he had yet seen; and, having crossed\\r , over and surveyed it from the opposite pavement, graciously announced\\r , his intention of putting up there, for the night.\\r , \\r , \\'So give us the bundle,\\' said Noah, unstrapping it from the woman\\'s\\r , shoulders, and slinging it over his own; \\'and don\\'t yer speak, except\\r , when yer spoke to.  What\\'s the name of the house--t-h-r--three what?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Cripples,\\' said Charlotte.\\r , \\r , \\'Three Cripples,\\' repeated Noah, \\'and a very good sign too.  Now, then!\\r , Keep close at my heels, and come along.\\'  With these injunctions, he\\r , pushed the rattling door with his shoulder, and entered the house,\\r , followed by his companion.\\r , \\r , There was nobody in the bar but a young Jew, who, with his two elbows\\r , on the counter, was reading a dirty newspaper. He stared very hard at\\r , Noah, and Noah stared very hard at him.\\r , \\r , If Noah had been attired in his charity-boy\\'s dress, there might have\\r , been some reason for the Jew opening his eyes so wide; but as he had\\r , discarded the coat and badge, and wore a short smock-frock over his\\r , leathers, there seemed no particular reason for his appearance exciting\\r , so much attention in a public-house.\\r , \\r , \\'Is this the Three Cripples?\\' asked Noah.\\r , \\r , \\'That is the dabe of this \\'ouse,\\' replied the Jew.\\r , \\r , \\'A gentleman we met on the road, coming up from the country,\\r , recommended us here,\\' said Noah, nudging Charlotte, perhaps to call her\\r , attention to this most ingenious device for attracting respect, and\\r , perhaps to warn her to betray no surprise.  \\'We want to sleep here\\r , to-night.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'b dot certaid you cad,\\' said Barney, who was the attendant sprite;\\r , \\'but I\\'ll idquire.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Show us the tap, and give us a bit of cold meat and a drop of beer\\r , while yer inquiring, will yer?\\' said Noah.\\r , \\r , Barney complied by ushering them into a small back-room, and setting\\r , the required viands before them; having done which, he informed the\\r , travellers that they could be lodged that night, and left the amiable\\r , couple to their refreshment.\\r , \\r , Now, this back-room was immediately behind the bar, and some steps\\r , lower, so that any person connected with the house, undrawing a small\\r , curtain which concealed a single pane of glass fixed in the wall of the\\r , last-named apartment, about five feet from its flooring, could not only\\r , look down upon any guests in the back-room without any great hazard of\\r , being observed (the glass being in a dark angle of the wall, between\\r , which and a large upright beam the observer had to thrust himself), but\\r , could, by applying his ear to the partition, ascertain with tolerable\\r , distinctness, their subject of conversation.  The landlord of the house\\r , had not withdrawn his eye from this place of espial for five minutes,\\r , and Barney had only just returned from making the communication above\\r , related, when Fagin, in the course of his evening\\'s business, came into\\r , the bar to inquire after some of his young pupils.\\r , \\r , \\'Hush!\\' said Barney:  \\'stradegers id the next roob.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Strangers!\\' repeated the old man in a whisper.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!  Ad rub uds too,\\' added Barney.  \\'Frob the cuttry, but subthig in\\r , your way, or I\\'b bistaked.\\'\\r , \\r , Fagin appeared to receive this communication with great interest.\\r , \\r , Mounting a stool, he cautiously applied his eye to the pane of glass,\\r , from which secret post he could see Mr. Claypole taking cold beef from\\r , the dish, and porter from the pot, and administering homeopathic doses\\r , of both to Charlotte, who sat patiently by, eating and drinking at his\\r , pleasure.\\r , \\r , \\'Aha!\\' he whispered, looking round to Barney, \\'I like that fellow\\'s\\r , looks.  He\\'d be of use to us; he knows how to train the girl already.\\r , Don\\'t make as much noise as a mouse, my dear, and let me hear \\'em\\r , talk--let me hear \\'em.\\'\\r , \\r , He again applied his eye to the glass, and turning his ear to the\\r , partition, listened attentively:  with a subtle and eager look upon his\\r , face, that might have appertained to some old goblin.\\r , \\r , \\'So I mean to be a gentleman,\\' said Mr. Claypole, kicking out his legs,\\r , and continuing a conversation, the commencement of which Fagin had\\r , arrived too late to hear. \\'No more jolly old coffins, Charlotte, but a\\r , gentleman\\'s life for me:  and, if yer like, yer shall be a lady.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I should like that well enough, dear,\\' replied Charlotte; \\'but tills\\r , ain\\'t to be emptied every day, and people to get clear off after it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Tills be blowed!\\' said Mr. Claypole; \\'there\\'s more things besides\\r , tills to be emptied.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What do you mean?\\' asked his companion.\\r , \\r , \\'Pockets, women\\'s ridicules, houses, mail-coaches, banks!\\' said Mr.\\r , Claypole, rising with the porter.\\r , \\r , \\'But you can\\'t do all that, dear,\\' said Charlotte.\\r , \\r , \\'I shall look out to get into company with them as can,\\' replied Noah.\\r , \\'They\\'ll be able to make us useful some way or another. Why, you\\r , yourself are worth fifty women; I never see such a precious sly and\\r , deceitful creetur as yer can be when I let yer.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Lor, how nice it is to hear yer say so!\\' exclaimed Charlotte,\\r , imprinting a kiss upon his ugly face.\\r , \\r , \\'There, that\\'ll do:  don\\'t yer be too affectionate, in case I\\'m cross\\r , with yer,\\' said Noah, disengaging himself with great gravity.  \\'I\\r , should like to be the captain of some band, and have the whopping of\\r , \\'em, and follering \\'em about, unbeknown to themselves.  That would suit\\r , me, if there was good profit; and if we could only get in with some\\r , gentleman of this sort, I say it would be cheap at that twenty-pound\\r , note you\\'ve got,--especially as we don\\'t very well know how to get rid\\r , of it ourselves.\\'\\r , \\r , After expressing this opinion, Mr. Claypole looked into the porter-pot\\r , with an aspect of deep wisdom; and having well shaken its contents,\\r , nodded condescendingly to Charlotte, and took a draught, wherewith he\\r , appeared greatly refreshed.  He was meditating another, when the sudden\\r , opening of the door, and the appearance of a stranger, interrupted him.\\r , \\r , The stranger was Mr. Fagin.  And very amiable he looked, and a very low\\r , bow he made, as he advanced, and setting himself down at the nearest\\r , table, ordered something to drink of the grinning Barney.\\r , \\r , \\'A pleasant night, sir, but cool for the time of year,\\' said Fagin,\\r , rubbing his hands.  \\'From the country, I see, sir?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'How do yer see that?\\' asked Noah Claypole.\\r , \\r , \\'We have not so much dust as that in London,\\' replied Fagin, pointing\\r , from Noah\\'s shoes to those of his companion, and from them to the two\\r , bundles.\\r , \\r , \\'Yer a sharp feller,\\' said Noah.  \\'Ha! ha! only hear that, Charlotte!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why, one need be sharp in this town, my dear,\\' replied the Jew,\\r , sinking his voice to a confidential whisper; \\'and that\\'s the truth.\\'\\r , \\r , Fagin followed up this remark by striking the side of his nose with his\\r , right forefinger,--a gesture which Noah attempted to imitate, though\\r , not with complete success, in consequence of his own nose not being\\r , large enough for the purpose.  However, Mr. Fagin seemed to interpret\\r , the endeavour as expressing a perfect coincidence with his opinion, and\\r , put about the liquor which Barney reappeared with, in a very friendly\\r , manner.\\r , \\r , \\'Good stuff that,\\' observed Mr. Claypole, smacking his lips.\\r , \\r , \\'Dear!\\' said Fagin.  \\'A man need be always emptying a till, or a\\r , pocket, or a woman\\'s reticule, or a house, or a mail-coach, or a bank,\\r , if he drinks it regularly.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Claypole no sooner heard this extract from his own remarks than he\\r , fell back in his chair, and looked from the Jew to Charlotte with a\\r , countenance of ashy paleness and excessive terror.\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t mind me, my dear,\\' said Fagin, drawing his chair closer. \\'Ha!\\r , ha! it was lucky it was only me that heard you by chance. It was very\\r , lucky it was only me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I didn\\'t take it,\\' stammered Noah, no longer stretching out his legs\\r , like an independent gentleman, but coiling them up as well as he could\\r , under his chair; \\'it was all her doing; yer\\'ve got it now, Charlotte,\\r , yer know yer have.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No matter who\\'s got it, or who did it, my dear,\\' replied Fagin,\\r , glancing, nevertheless, with a hawk\\'s eye at the girl and the two\\r , bundles.  \\'I\\'m in that way myself, and I like you for it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'In what way?\\' asked Mr. Claypole, a little recovering.\\r , \\r , \\'In that way of business,\\' rejoined Fagin; \\'and so are the people of\\r , the house.  You\\'ve hit the right nail upon the head, and are as safe\\r , here as you could be.  There is not a safer place in all this town than\\r , is the Cripples; that is, when I like to make it so.  And I have taken\\r , a fancy to you and the young woman; so I\\'ve said the word, and you may\\r , make your minds easy.\\'\\r , \\r , Noah Claypole\\'s mind might have been at ease after this assurance, but\\r , his body certainly was not; for he shuffled and writhed about, into\\r , various uncouth positions:  eyeing his new friend meanwhile with\\r , mingled fear and suspicion.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ll tell you more,\\' said Fagin, after he had reassured the girl, by\\r , dint of friendly nods and muttered encouragements. \\'I have got a friend\\r , that I think can gratify your darling wish, and put you in the right\\r , way, where you can take whatever department of the business you think\\r , will suit you best at first, and be taught all the others.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yer speak as if yer were in earnest,\\' replied Noah.\\r , \\r , \\'What advantage would it be to me to be anything else?\\' inquired Fagin,\\r , shrugging his shoulders.  \\'Here!  Let me have a word with you outside.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'There\\'s no occasion to trouble ourselves to move,\\' said Noah, getting\\r , his legs by gradual degrees abroad again. \\'She\\'ll take the luggage\\r , upstairs the while.  Charlotte, see to them bundles.\\'\\r , \\r , This mandate, which had been delivered with great majesty, was obeyed\\r , without the slightest demur; and Charlotte made the best of her way off\\r , with the packages while Noah held the door open and watched her out.\\r , \\r , \\'She\\'s kept tolerably well under, ain\\'t she?\\' he asked as he resumed\\r , his seat:  in the tone of a keeper who had tamed some wild animal.\\r , \\r , \\'Quite perfect,\\' rejoined Fagin, clapping him on the shoulder. \\'You\\'re\\r , a genius, my dear.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why, I suppose if I wasn\\'t, I shouldn\\'t be here,\\' replied Noah. \\'But,\\r , I say, she\\'ll be back if yer lose time.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Now, what do you think?\\' said Fagin.  \\'If you was to like my friend,\\r , could you do better than join him?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Is he in a good way of business; that\\'s where it is!\\' responded Noah,\\r , winking one of his little eyes.\\r , \\r , \\'The top of the tree; employs a power of hands; has the very best\\r , society in the profession.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Regular town-maders?\\' asked Mr. Claypole.\\r , \\r , \\'Not a countryman among \\'em; and I don\\'t think he\\'d take you, even on\\r , my recommendation, if he didn\\'t run rather short of assistants just\\r , now,\\' replied Fagin.\\r , \\r , \\'Should I have to hand over?\\' said Noah, slapping his breeches-pocket.\\r , \\r , \\'It couldn\\'t possibly be done without,\\' replied Fagin, in a most\\r , decided manner.\\r , \\r , \\'Twenty pound, though--it\\'s a lot of money!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not when it\\'s in a note you can\\'t get rid of,\\' retorted Fagin. \\'Number\\r , and date taken, I suppose?  Payment stopped at the Bank? Ah!  It\\'s not\\r , worth much to him.  It\\'ll have to go abroad, and he couldn\\'t sell it\\r , for a great deal in the market.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'When could I see him?\\' asked Noah doubtfully.\\r , \\r , \\'To-morrow morning.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Where?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Here.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Um!\\' said Noah.  \\'What\\'s the wages?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Live like a gentleman--board and lodging, pipes and spirits free--half\\r , of all you earn, and half of all the young woman earns,\\' replied Mr.\\r , Fagin.\\r , \\r , Whether Noah Claypole, whose rapacity was none of the least\\r , comprehensive, would have acceded even to these glowing terms, had he\\r , been a perfectly free agent, is very doubtful; but as he recollected\\r , that, in the event of his refusal, it was in the power of his new\\r , acquaintance to give him up to justice immediately (and more unlikely\\r , things had come to pass), he gradually relented, and said he thought\\r , that would suit him.\\r , \\r , \\'But, yer see,\\' observed Noah, \\'as she will be able to do a good deal,\\r , I should like to take something very light.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'A little fancy work?\\' suggested Fagin.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah! something of that sort,\\' replied Noah.  \\'What do you think would\\r , suit me now?  Something not too trying for the strength, and not very\\r , dangerous, you know.  That\\'s the sort of thing!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I heard you talk of something in the spy way upon the others, my\\r , dear,\\' said Fagin.  \\'My friend wants somebody who would do that well,\\r , very much.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why, I did mention that, and I shouldn\\'t mind turning my hand to it\\r , sometimes,\\' rejoined Mr. Claypole slowly; \\'but it wouldn\\'t pay by\\r , itself, you know.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s true!\\' observed the Jew, ruminating or pretending to ruminate.\\r , \\'No, it might not.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What do you think, then?\\' asked Noah, anxiously regarding him.\\r , \\'Something in the sneaking way, where it was pretty sure work, and not\\r , much more risk than being at home.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What do you think of the old ladies?\\' asked Fagin. \\'There\\'s a good\\r , deal of money made in snatching their bags and parcels, and running\\r , round the corner.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t they holler out a good deal, and scratch sometimes?\\' asked Noah,\\r , shaking his head.  \\'I don\\'t think that would answer my purpose.  Ain\\'t\\r , there any other line open?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Stop!\\' said Fagin, laying his hand on Noah\\'s knee.  \\'The kinchin lay.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s that?\\' demanded Mr. Claypole.\\r , \\r , \\'The kinchins, my dear,\\' said Fagin, \\'is the young children that\\'s sent\\r , on errands by their mothers, with sixpences and shillings; and the lay\\r , is just to take their money away--they\\'ve always got it ready in their\\r , hands,--then knock \\'em into the kennel, and walk off very slow, as if\\r , there were nothing else the matter but a child fallen down and hurt\\r , itself.  Ha! ha! ha!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ha! ha!\\' roared Mr. Claypole, kicking up his legs in an ecstasy.\\r , \\'Lord, that\\'s the very thing!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'To be sure it is,\\' replied Fagin; \\'and you can have a few good beats\\r , chalked out in Camden Town, and Battle Bridge, and neighborhoods like\\r , that, where they\\'re always going errands; and you can upset as many\\r , kinchins as you want, any hour in the day. Ha! ha! ha!\\'\\r , \\r , With this, Fagin poked Mr. Claypole in the side, and they joined in a\\r , burst of laughter both long and loud.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, that\\'s all right!\\' said Noah, when he had recovered himself, and\\r , Charlotte had returned.  \\'What time to-morrow shall we say?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Will ten do?\\' asked Fagin, adding, as Mr. Claypole nodded assent,\\r , \\'What name shall I tell my good friend.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Mr. Bolter,\\' replied Noah, who had prepared himself for such\\r , emergency.  \\'Mr. Morris Bolter.  This is Mrs. Bolter.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Mrs. Bolter\\'s humble servant,\\' said Fagin, bowing with grotesque\\r , politeness.  \\'I hope I shall know her better very shortly.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Do you hear the gentleman, Charlotte?\\' thundered Mr. Claypole.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, Noah, dear!\\' replied Mrs. Bolter, extending her hand.\\r , \\r , \\'She calls me Noah, as a sort of fond way of talking,\\' said Mr. Morris\\r , Bolter, late Claypole, turning to Fagin.  \\'You understand?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh yes, I understand--perfectly,\\' replied Fagin, telling the truth for\\r , once.  \\'Good-night!  Good-night!\\'\\r , \\r , With many adieus and good wishes, Mr. Fagin went his way. Noah\\r , Claypole, bespeaking his good lady\\'s attention, proceeded to enlighten\\r , her relative to the arrangement he had made, with all that haughtiness\\r , and air of superiority, becoming, not only a member of the sterner sex,\\r , but a gentleman who appreciated the dignity of a special appointment on\\r , the kinchin lay, in London and its vicinity.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XLIII\\r , \\r , WHEREIN IS SHOWN HOW THE ARTFUL DODGER GOT INTO TROUBLE\\r , \\r , \\'And so it was you that was your own friend, was it?\\' asked Mr.\\r , Claypole, otherwise Bolter, when, by virtue of the compact entered into\\r , between them, he had removed next day to Fagin\\'s house.  \\'\\'Cod, I\\r , thought as much last night!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Every man\\'s his own friend, my dear,\\' replied Fagin, with his most\\r , insinuating grin.  \\'He hasn\\'t as good a one as himself anywhere.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Except sometimes,\\' replied Morris Bolter, assuming the air of a man of\\r , the world.  \\'Some people are nobody\\'s enemies but their own, yer know.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t believe that,\\' said Fagin.  \\'When a man\\'s his own enemy, it\\'s\\r , only because he\\'s too much his own friend; not because he\\'s careful for\\r , everybody but himself.  Pooh! pooh!  There ain\\'t such a thing in\\r , nature.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'There oughn\\'t to be, if there is,\\' replied Mr. Bolter.\\r , \\r , \\'That stands to reason.  Some conjurers say that number three is the\\r , magic number, and some say number seven.  It\\'s neither, my friend,\\r , neither.  It\\'s number one.\\r , \\r , \\'Ha! ha!\\' cried Mr. Bolter.  \\'Number one for ever.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'In a little community like ours, my dear,\\' said Fagin, who felt it\\r , necessary to qualify this position, \\'we have a general number one,\\r , without considering me too as the same, and all the other young people.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, the devil!\\' exclaimed Mr. Bolter.\\r , \\r , \\'You see,\\' pursued Fagin, affecting to disregard this interruption, \\'we\\r , are so mixed up together, and identified in our interests, that it must\\r , be so.  For instance, it\\'s your object to take care of number\\r , one--meaning yourself.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Certainly,\\' replied Mr. Bolter.  \\'Yer about right there.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well!  You can\\'t take care of yourself, number one, without taking\\r , care of me, number one.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Number two, you mean,\\' said Mr. Bolter, who was largely endowed with\\r , the quality of selfishness.\\r , \\r , \\'No, I don\\'t!\\' retorted Fagin.  \\'I\\'m of the same importance to you, as\\r , you are to yourself.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I say,\\' interrupted Mr. Bolter, \\'yer a very nice man, and I\\'m very\\r , fond of yer; but we ain\\'t quite so thick together, as all that comes\\r , to.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Only think,\\' said Fagin, shrugging his shoulders, and stretching out\\r , his hands; \\'only consider.  You\\'ve done what\\'s a very pretty thing, and\\r , what I love you for doing; but what at the same time would put the\\r , cravat round your throat, that\\'s so very easily tied and so very\\r , difficult to unloose--in plain English, the halter!\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bolter put his hand to his neckerchief, as if he felt it\\r , inconveniently tight; and murmured an assent, qualified in tone but not\\r , in substance.\\r , \\r , \\'The gallows,\\' continued Fagin, \\'the gallows, my dear, is an ugly\\r , finger-post, which points out a very short and sharp turning that has\\r , stopped many a bold fellow\\'s career on the broad highway.  To keep in\\r , the easy road, and keep it at a distance, is object number one with\\r , you.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Of course it is,\\' replied Mr. Bolter.  \\'What do yer talk about such\\r , things for?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Only to show you my meaning clearly,\\' said the Jew, raising his\\r , eyebrows.  \\'To be able to do that, you depend upon me. To keep my\\r , little business all snug, I depend upon you. The first is your number\\r , one, the second my number one.  The more you value your number one, the\\r , more careful you must be of mine; so we come at last to what I told you\\r , at first--that a regard for number one holds us all together, and must\\r , do so, unless we would all go to pieces in company.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s true,\\' rejoined Mr. Bolter, thoughtfully.  \\'Oh! yer a cunning\\r , old codger!\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Fagin saw, with delight, that this tribute to his powers was no\\r , mere compliment, but that he had really impressed his recruit with a\\r , sense of his wily genius, which it was most important that he should\\r , entertain in the outset of their acquaintance.  To strengthen an\\r , impression so desirable and useful, he followed up the blow by\\r , acquainting him, in some detail, with the magnitude and extent of his\\r , operations; blending truth and fiction together, as best served his\\r , purpose; and bringing both to bear, with so much art, that Mr. Bolter\\'s\\r , respect visibly increased, and became tempered, at the same time, with\\r , a degree of wholesome fear, which it was highly desirable to awaken.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s this mutual trust we have in each other that consoles me under\\r , heavy losses,\\' said Fagin.  \\'My best hand was taken from me, yesterday\\r , morning.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You don\\'t mean to say he died?\\' cried Mr. Bolter.\\r , \\r , \\'No, no,\\' replied Fagin, \\'not so bad as that.  Not quite so bad.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What, I suppose he was--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Wanted,\\' interposed Fagin.  \\'Yes, he was wanted.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Very particular?\\' inquired Mr. Bolter.\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' replied Fagin, \\'not very.  He was charged with attempting to pick\\r , a pocket, and they found a silver snuff-box on him,--his own, my dear,\\r , his own, for he took snuff himself, and was very fond of it.  They\\r , remanded him till to-day, for they thought they knew the owner.  Ah! he\\r , was worth fifty boxes, and I\\'d give the price of as many to have him\\r , back.  You should have known the Dodger, my dear; you should have known\\r , the Dodger.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, but I shall know him, I hope; don\\'t yer think so?\\' said Mr.\\r , Bolter.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'m doubtful about it,\\' replied Fagin, with a sigh.  \\'If they don\\'t\\r , get any fresh evidence, it\\'ll only be a summary conviction, and we\\r , shall have him back again after six weeks or so; but, if they do, it\\'s\\r , a case of lagging.  They know what a clever lad he is; he\\'ll be a\\r , lifer.  They\\'ll make the Artful nothing less than a lifer.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What do you mean by lagging and a lifer?\\' demanded Mr. Bolter. \\'What\\'s\\r , the good of talking in that way to me; why don\\'t yer speak so as I can\\r , understand yer?\\'\\r , \\r , Fagin was about to translate these mysterious expressions into the\\r , vulgar tongue; and, being interpreted, Mr. Bolter would have been\\r , informed that they represented that combination of words,\\r , \\'transportation for life,\\' when the dialogue was cut short by the entry\\r , of Master Bates, with his hands in his breeches-pockets, and his face\\r , twisted into a look of semi-comical woe.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s all up, Fagin,\\' said Charley, when he and his new companion had\\r , been made known to each other.\\r , \\r , \\'What do you mean?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'They\\'ve found the gentleman as owns the box; two or three more\\'s a\\r , coming to \\'dentify him; and the Artful\\'s booked for a passage out,\\'\\r , replied Master Bates.  \\'I must have a full suit of mourning, Fagin, and\\r , a hatband, to wisit him in, afore he sets out upon his travels.  To\\r , think of Jack Dawkins--lummy Jack--the Dodger--the Artful Dodger--going\\r , abroad for a common twopenny-halfpenny sneeze-box!  I never thought\\r , he\\'d a done it under a gold watch, chain, and seals, at the lowest.\\r , Oh, why didn\\'t he rob some rich old gentleman of all his walables, and\\r , go out as a gentleman, and not like a common prig, without no honour\\r , nor glory!\\'\\r , \\r , With this expression of feeling for his unfortunate friend, Master\\r , Bates sat himself on the nearest chair with an aspect of chagrin and\\r , despondency.\\r , \\r , \\'What do you talk about his having neither honour nor glory for!\\'\\r , exclaimed Fagin, darting an angry look at his pupil. \\'Wasn\\'t he always\\r , the top-sawyer among you all!  Is there one of you that could touch him\\r , or come near him on any scent!  Eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not one,\\' replied Master Bates, in a voice rendered husky by regret;\\r , \\'not one.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then what do you talk of?\\' replied Fagin angrily; \\'what are you\\r , blubbering for?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'\\'Cause it isn\\'t on the rec-ord, is it?\\' said Charley, chafed into\\r , perfect defiance of his venerable friend by the current of his regrets;\\r , \\'\\'cause it can\\'t come out in the \\'dictment; \\'cause nobody will never\\r , know half of what he was.  How will he stand in the Newgate Calendar?\\r , P\\'raps not be there at all.  Oh, my eye, my eye, wot a blow it is!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ha! ha!\\' cried Fagin, extending his right hand, and turning to Mr.\\r , Bolter in a fit of chuckling which shook him as though he had the\\r , palsy; \\'see what a pride they take in their profession, my dear.  Ain\\'t\\r , it beautiful?\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Bolter nodded assent, and Fagin, after contemplating the grief of\\r , Charley Bates for some seconds with evident satisfaction, stepped up to\\r , that young gentleman and patted him on the shoulder.\\r , \\r , \\'Never mind, Charley,\\' said Fagin soothingly; \\'it\\'ll come out, it\\'ll be\\r , sure to come out.  They\\'ll all know what a clever fellow he was; he\\'ll\\r , show it himself, and not disgrace his old pals and teachers.  Think how\\r , young he is too!  What a distinction, Charley, to be lagged at his time\\r , of life!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, it is a honour that is!\\' said Charley, a little consoled.\\r , \\r , \\'He shall have all he wants,\\' continued the Jew.  \\'He shall be kept in\\r , the Stone Jug, Charley, like a gentleman.  Like a gentleman!  With his\\r , beer every day, and money in his pocket to pitch and toss with, if he\\r , can\\'t spend it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, shall he though?\\' cried Charley Bates.\\r , \\r , \\'Ay, that he shall,\\' replied Fagin, \\'and we\\'ll have a big-wig, Charley:\\r , one that\\'s got the greatest gift of the gab:  to carry on his defence;\\r , and he shall make a speech for himself too, if he likes; and we\\'ll read\\r , it all in the papers--\"Artful Dodger--shrieks of laughter--here the\\r , court was convulsed\"--eh, Charley, eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ha! ha!\\' laughed Master Bates, \\'what a lark that would be, wouldn\\'t\\r , it, Fagin?  I say, how the Artful would bother \\'em wouldn\\'t he?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Would!\\' cried Fagin.  \\'He shall--he will!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah, to be sure, so he will,\\' repeated Charley, rubbing his hands.\\r , \\r , \\'I think I see him now,\\' cried the Jew, bending his eyes upon his pupil.\\r , \\r , \\'So do I,\\' cried Charley Bates.  \\'Ha! ha! ha! so do I.  I see it all\\r , afore me, upon my soul I do, Fagin.  What a game!  What a regular game!\\r , All the big-wigs trying to look solemn, and Jack Dawkins addressing of\\r , \\'em as intimate and comfortable as if he was the judge\\'s own son making\\r , a speech arter dinner--ha! ha! ha!\\'\\r , \\r , In fact, Mr. Fagin had so well humoured his young friend\\'s eccentric\\r , disposition, that Master Bates, who had at first been disposed to\\r , consider the imprisoned Dodger rather in the light of a victim, now\\r , looked upon him as the chief actor in a scene of most uncommon and\\r , exquisite humour, and felt quite impatient for the arrival of the time\\r , when his old companion should have so favourable an opportunity of\\r , displaying his abilities.\\r , \\r , \\'We must know how he gets on to-day, by some handy means or other,\\'\\r , said Fagin.  \\'Let me think.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Shall I go?\\' asked Charley.\\r , \\r , \\'Not for the world,\\' replied Fagin.  \\'Are you mad, my dear, stark mad,\\r , that you\\'d walk into the very place where--No, Charley, no. One is\\r , enough to lose at a time.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You don\\'t mean to go yourself, I suppose?\\' said Charley with a\\r , humorous leer.\\r , \\r , \\'That wouldn\\'t quite fit,\\' replied Fagin shaking his head.\\r , \\r , \\'Then why don\\'t you send this new cove?\\' asked Master Bates, laying his\\r , hand on Noah\\'s arm.  \\'Nobody knows him.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why, if he didn\\'t mind--\\' observed Fagin.\\r , \\r , \\'Mind!\\' interposed Charley.  \\'What should he have to mind?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Really nothing, my dear,\\' said Fagin, turning to Mr. Bolter, \\'really\\r , nothing.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, I dare say about that, yer know,\\' observed Noah, backing towards\\r , the door, and shaking his head with a kind of sober alarm.  \\'No,\\r , no--none of that.  It\\'s not in my department, that ain\\'t.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Wot department has he got, Fagin?\\' inquired Master Bates, surveying\\r , Noah\\'s lank form with much disgust.  \\'The cutting away when there\\'s\\r , anything wrong, and the eating all the wittles when there\\'s everything\\r , right; is that his branch?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Never mind,\\' retorted Mr. Bolter; \\'and don\\'t yer take liberties with\\r , yer superiors, little boy, or yer\\'ll find yerself in the wrong shop.\\'\\r , \\r , Master Bates laughed so vehemently at this magnificent threat, that it\\r , was some time before Fagin could interpose, and represent to Mr. Bolter\\r , that he incurred no possible danger in visiting the police-office;\\r , that, inasmuch as no account of the little affair in which he had\\r , engaged, nor any description of his person, had yet been forwarded to\\r , the metropolis, it was very probable that he was not even suspected of\\r , having resorted to it for shelter; and that, if he were properly\\r , disguised, it would be as safe a spot for him to visit as any in\\r , London, inasmuch as it would be, of all places, the very last, to which\\r , he could be supposed likely to resort of his own free will.\\r , \\r , Persuaded, in part, by these representations, but overborne in a much\\r , greater degree by his fear of Fagin, Mr. Bolter at length consented,\\r , with a very bad grace, to undertake the expedition. By Fagin\\'s\\r , directions, he immediately substituted for his own attire, a waggoner\\'s\\r , frock, velveteen breeches, and leather leggings:  all of which articles\\r , the Jew had at hand.  He was likewise furnished with a felt hat well\\r , garnished with turnpike tickets; and a carter\\'s whip.  Thus equipped,\\r , he was to saunter into the office, as some country fellow from Covent\\r , Garden market might be supposed to do for the gratification of his\\r , curiousity; and as he was as awkward, ungainly, and raw-boned a fellow\\r , as need be, Mr. Fagin had no fear but that he would look the part to\\r , perfection.\\r , \\r , These arrangements completed, he was informed of the necessary signs\\r , and tokens by which to recognise the Artful Dodger, and was conveyed by\\r , Master Bates through dark and winding ways to within a very short\\r , distance of Bow Street. Having described the precise situation of the\\r , office, and accompanied it with copious directions how he was to walk\\r , straight up the passage, and when he got into the side, and pull off\\r , his hat as he went into the room, Charley Bates bade him hurry on\\r , alone, and promised to bide his return on the spot of their parting.\\r , \\r , Noah Claypole, or Morris Bolter as the reader pleases, punctually\\r , followed the directions he had received, which--Master Bates being\\r , pretty well acquainted with the locality--were so exact that he was\\r , enabled to gain the magisterial presence without asking any question,\\r , or meeting with any interruption by the way.\\r , \\r , He found himself jostled among a crowd of people, chiefly women, who\\r , were huddled together in a dirty frowsy room, at the upper end of which\\r , was a raised platform railed off from the rest, with a dock for the\\r , prisoners on the left hand against the wall, a box for the witnesses in\\r , the middle, and a desk for the magistrates on the right; the awful\\r , locality last named, being screened off by a partition which concealed\\r , the bench from the common gaze, and left the vulgar to imagine (if they\\r , could) the full majesty of justice.\\r , \\r , There were only a couple of women in the dock, who were nodding to\\r , their admiring friends, while the clerk read some depositions to a\\r , couple of policemen and a man in plain clothes who leant over the\\r , table.  A jailer stood reclining against the dock-rail, tapping his\\r , nose listlessly with a large key, except when he repressed an undue\\r , tendency to conversation among the idlers, by proclaiming silence; or\\r , looked sternly up to bid some woman \\'Take that baby out,\\' when the\\r , gravity of justice was disturbed by feeble cries, half-smothered in the\\r , mother\\'s shawl, from some meagre infant.  The room smelt close and\\r , unwholesome; the walls were dirt-discoloured; and the ceiling\\r , blackened.  There was an old smoky bust over the mantel-shelf, and a\\r , dusty clock above the dock--the only thing present, that seemed to go\\r , on as it ought; for depravity, or poverty, or an habitual acquaintance\\r , with both, had left a taint on all the animate matter, hardly less\\r , unpleasant than the thick greasy scum on every inanimate object that\\r , frowned upon it.\\r , \\r , Noah looked eagerly about him for the Dodger; but although there were\\r , several women who would have done very well for that distinguished\\r , character\\'s mother or sister, and more than one man who might be\\r , supposed to bear a strong resemblance to his father, nobody at all\\r , answering the description given him of Mr. Dawkins was to be seen.  He\\r , waited in a state of much suspense and uncertainty until the women,\\r , being committed for trial, went flaunting out; and then was quickly\\r , relieved by the appearance of another prisoner who he felt at once\\r , could be no other than the object of his visit.\\r , \\r , It was indeed Mr. Dawkins, who, shuffling into the office with the big\\r , coat sleeves tucked up as usual, his left hand in his pocket, and his\\r , hat in his right hand, preceded the jailer, with a rolling gait\\r , altogether indescribable, and, taking his place in the dock, requested\\r , in an audible voice to know what he was placed in that \\'ere disgraceful\\r , sitivation for.\\r , \\r , \\'Hold your tongue, will you?\\' said the jailer.\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'m an Englishman, ain\\'t I?\\' rejoined the Dodger.  \\'Where are my\\r , priwileges?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'ll get your privileges soon enough,\\' retorted the jailer, \\'and\\r , pepper with \\'em.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'We\\'ll see wot the Secretary of State for the Home Affairs has got to\\r , say to the beaks, if I don\\'t,\\' replied Mr. Dawkins.  \\'Now then!  Wot is\\r , this here business?  I shall thank the madg\\'strates to dispose of this\\r , here little affair, and not to keep me while they read the paper, for\\r , I\\'ve got an appointment with a genelman in the City, and as I am a man\\r , of my word and wery punctual in business matters, he\\'ll go away if I\\r , ain\\'t there to my time, and then pr\\'aps ther won\\'t be an action for\\r , damage against them as kep me away.  Oh no, certainly not!\\'\\r , \\r , At this point, the Dodger, with a show of being very particular with a\\r , view to proceedings to be had thereafter, desired the jailer to\\r , communicate \\'the names of them two files as was on the bench.\\'  Which\\r , so tickled the spectators, that they laughed almost as heartily as\\r , Master Bates could have done if he had heard the request.\\r , \\r , \\'Silence there!\\' cried the jailer.\\r , \\r , \\'What is this?\\' inquired one of the magistrates.\\r , \\r , \\'A pick-pocketing case, your worship.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Has the boy ever been here before?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He ought to have been, a many times,\\' replied the jailer. \\'He has been\\r , pretty well everywhere else.  _I_ know him well, your worship.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh! you know me, do you?\\' cried the Artful, making a note of the\\r , statement.  \\'Wery good.  That\\'s a case of deformation of character, any\\r , way.\\'\\r , \\r , Here there was another laugh, and another cry of silence.\\r , \\r , \\'Now then, where are the witnesses?\\' said the clerk.\\r , \\r , \\'Ah! that\\'s right,\\' added the Dodger.  \\'Where are they?  I should like\\r , to see \\'em.\\'\\r , \\r , This wish was immediately gratified, for a policeman stepped forward\\r , who had seen the prisoner attempt the pocket of an unknown gentleman in\\r , a crowd, and indeed take a handkerchief therefrom, which, being a very\\r , old one, he deliberately put back again, after trying it on his own\\r , countenance.  For this reason, he took the Dodger into custody as soon\\r , as he could get near him, and the said Dodger, being searched, had upon\\r , his person a silver snuff-box, with the owner\\'s name engraved upon the\\r , lid.  This gentleman had been discovered on reference to the Court\\r , Guide, and being then and there present, swore that the snuff-box was\\r , his, and that he had missed it on the previous day, the moment he had\\r , disengaged himself from the crowd before referred to.  He had also\\r , remarked a young gentleman in the throng, particularly active in making\\r , his way about, and that young gentleman was the prisoner before him.\\r , \\r , \\'Have you anything to ask this witness, boy?\\' said the magistrate.\\r , \\r , \\'I wouldn\\'t abase myself by descending to hold no conversation with\\r , him,\\' replied the Dodger.\\r , \\r , \\'Have you anything to say at all?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Do you hear his worship ask if you\\'ve anything to say?\\' inquired the\\r , jailer, nudging the silent Dodger with his elbow.\\r , \\r , \\'I beg your pardon,\\' said the Dodger, looking up with an air of\\r , abstraction.  \\'Did you redress yourself to me, my man?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I never see such an out-and-out young wagabond, your worship,\\'\\r , observed the officer with a grin.  \\'Do you mean to say anything, you\\r , young shaver?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' replied the Dodger, \\'not here, for this ain\\'t the shop for\\r , justice:  besides which, my attorney is a-breakfasting this morning\\r , with the Wice President of the House of Commons; but I shall have\\r , something to say elsewhere, and so will he, and so will a wery numerous\\r , and \\'spectable circle of acquaintance as\\'ll make them beaks wish they\\'d\\r , never been born, or that they\\'d got their footmen to hang \\'em up to\\r , their own hat-pegs, afore they let \\'em come out this morning to try it\\r , on upon me.  I\\'ll--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'There!  He\\'s fully committed!\\' interposed the clerk. \\'Take him away.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Come on,\\' said the jailer.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh ah!  I\\'ll come on,\\' replied the Dodger, brushing his hat with the\\r , palm of his hand.  \\'Ah! (to the Bench) it\\'s no use your looking\\r , frightened; I won\\'t show you no mercy, not a ha\\'porth of it.  _You\\'ll_\\r , pay for this, my fine fellers.  I wouldn\\'t be you for something!  I\\r , wouldn\\'t go free, now, if you was to fall down on your knees and ask\\r , me.  Here, carry me off to prison!  Take me away!\\'\\r , \\r , With these last words, the Dodger suffered himself to be led off by the\\r , collar; threatening, till he got into the yard, to make a parliamentary\\r , business of it; and then grinning in the officer\\'s face, with great\\r , glee and self-approval.\\r , \\r , Having seen him locked up by himself in a little cell, Noah made the\\r , best of his way back to where he had left Master Bates. After waiting\\r , here some time, he was joined by that young gentleman, who had\\r , prudently abstained from showing himself until he had looked carefully\\r , abroad from a snug retreat, and ascertained that his new friend had not\\r , been followed by any impertinent person.\\r , \\r , The two hastened back together, to bear to Mr. Fagin the animating news\\r , that the Dodger was doing full justice to his bringing-up, and\\r , establishing for himself a glorious reputation.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XLIV\\r , \\r , THE TIME ARRIVES FOR NANCY TO REDEEM HER PLEDGE TO ROSE MAYLIE. SHE\\r , FAILS.\\r , \\r , Adept as she was, in all the arts of cunning and dissimulation, the\\r , girl Nancy could not wholly conceal the effect which the knowledge of\\r , the step she had taken, wrought upon her mind.  She remembered that\\r , both the crafty Jew and the brutal Sikes had confided to her schemes,\\r , which had been hidden from all others: in the full confidence that she\\r , was trustworthy and beyond the reach of their suspicion.  Vile as those\\r , schemes were, desperate as were their originators, and bitter as were\\r , her feelings towards Fagin, who had led her, step by step, deeper and\\r , deeper down into an abyss of crime and misery, whence was no escape;\\r , still, there were times when, even towards him, she felt some\\r , relenting, lest her disclosure should bring him within the iron grasp\\r , he had so long eluded, and he should fall at last--richly as he merited\\r , such a fate--by her hand.\\r , \\r , But, these were the mere wanderings of a mind unable wholly to detach\\r , itself from old companions and associations, though enabled to fix\\r , itself steadily on one object, and resolved not to be turned aside by\\r , any consideration.  Her fears for Sikes would have been more powerful\\r , inducements to recoil while there was yet time; but she had stipulated\\r , that her secret should be rigidly kept, she had dropped no clue which\\r , could lead to his discovery, she had refused, even for his sake, a\\r , refuge from all the guilt and wretchedness that encompasses her--and\\r , what more could she do! She was resolved.\\r , \\r , Though all her mental struggles terminated in this conclusion, they\\r , forced themselves upon her, again and again, and left their traces too.\\r , She grew pale and thin, even within a few days.  At times, she took no\\r , heed of what was passing before her, or no part in conversations where\\r , once, she would have been the loudest.  At other times, she laughed\\r , without merriment, and was noisy without a moment afterwards--she sat\\r , silent and dejected, brooding with her head upon her hands, while the\\r , very effort by which she roused herself, told, more forcibly than even\\r , these indications, that she was ill at ease, and that her thoughts were\\r , occupied with matters very different and distant from those in the\\r , course of discussion by her companions.\\r , \\r , It was Sunday night, and the bell of the nearest church struck the\\r , hour.  Sikes and the Jew were talking, but they paused to listen.  The\\r , girl looked up from the low seat on which she crouched, and listened\\r , too.  Eleven.\\r , \\r , \\'An hour this side of midnight,\\' said Sikes, raising the blind to look\\r , out and returning to his seat.  \\'Dark and heavy it is too. A good night\\r , for business this.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!\\' replied Fagin.  \\'What a pity, Bill, my dear, that there\\'s none\\r , quite ready to be done.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'re right for once,\\' replied Sikes gruffly.  \\'It is a pity, for I\\'m\\r , in the humour too.\\'\\r , \\r , Fagin sighed, and shook his head despondingly.\\r , \\r , \\'We must make up for lost time when we\\'ve got things into a good train.\\r , That\\'s all I know,\\' said Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s the way to talk, my dear,\\' replied Fagin, venturing to pat him\\r , on the shoulder.  \\'It does me good to hear you.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Does you good, does it!\\' cried Sikes.  \\'Well, so be it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ha! ha! ha!\\' laughed Fagin, as if he were relieved by even this\\r , concession.  \\'You\\'re like yourself to-night, Bill.  Quite like\\r , yourself.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t feel like myself when you lay that withered old claw on my\\r , shoulder, so take it away,\\' said Sikes, casting off the Jew\\'s hand.\\r , \\r , \\'It make you nervous, Bill,--reminds you of being nabbed, does it?\\'\\r , said Fagin, determined not to be offended.\\r , \\r , \\'Reminds me of being nabbed by the devil,\\' returned Sikes. \\'There never\\r , was another man with such a face as yours, unless it was your father,\\r , and I suppose _he_ is singeing his grizzled red beard by this time,\\r , unless you came straight from the old \\'un without any father at all\\r , betwixt you; which I shouldn\\'t wonder at, a bit.\\'\\r , \\r , Fagin offered no reply to this compliment:  but, pulling Sikes by the\\r , sleeve, pointed his finger towards Nancy, who had taken advantage of\\r , the foregoing conversation to put on her bonnet, and was now leaving\\r , the room.\\r , \\r , \\'Hallo!\\' cried Sikes.  \\'Nance.  Where\\'s the gal going to at this time\\r , of night?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not far.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What answer\\'s that?\\' retorted Sikes.  \\'Do you hear me?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t know where,\\' replied the girl.\\r , \\r , \\'Then I do,\\' said Sikes, more in the spirit of obstinacy than because\\r , he had any real objection to the girl going where she listed.\\r , \\'Nowhere.  Sit down.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'m not well.  I told you that before,\\' rejoined the girl.  \\'I want a\\r , breath of air.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Put your head out of the winder,\\' replied Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'There\\'s not enough there,\\' said the girl.  \\'I want it in the street.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then you won\\'t have it,\\' replied Sikes.  With which assurance he rose,\\r , locked the door, took the key out, and pulling her bonnet from her\\r , head, flung it up to the top of an old press.  \\'There,\\' said the\\r , robber.  \\'Now stop quietly where you are, will you?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s not such a matter as a bonnet would keep me,\\' said the girl\\r , turning very pale.  \\'What do you mean, Bill?  Do you know what you\\'re\\r , doing?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Know what I\\'m--Oh!\\' cried Sikes, turning to Fagin, \\'she\\'s out of her\\r , senses, you know, or she daren\\'t talk to me in that way.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You\\'ll drive me on the something desperate,\\' muttered the girl placing\\r , both hands upon her breast, as though to keep down by force some\\r , violent outbreak.  \\'Let me go, will you,--this minute--this instant.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No!\\' said Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'Tell him to let me go, Fagin.  He had better.  It\\'ll be better for\\r , him.  Do you hear me?\\' cried Nancy stamping her foot upon the ground.\\r , \\r , \\'Hear you!\\' repeated Sikes turning round in his chair to confront her.\\r , \\'Aye!  And if I hear you for half a minute longer, the dog shall have\\r , such a grip on your throat as\\'ll tear some of that screaming voice out.\\r , Wot has come over you, you jade!  Wot is it?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Let me go,\\' said the girl with great earnestness; then sitting herself\\r , down on the floor, before the door, she said, \\'Bill, let me go; you\\r , don\\'t know what you are doing. You don\\'t, indeed.  For only one\\r , hour--do--do!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Cut my limbs off one by one!\\' cried Sikes, seizing her roughly by the\\r , arm, \\'If I don\\'t think the gal\\'s stark raving mad.  Get up.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not till you let me go--not till you let me go--Never--never!\\'\\r , screamed the girl.  Sikes looked on, for a minute, watching his\\r , opportunity, and suddenly pinioning her hands dragged her, struggling\\r , and wrestling with him by the way, into a small room adjoining, where\\r , he sat himself on a bench, and thrusting her into a chair, held her\\r , down by force.  She struggled and implored by turns until twelve\\r , o\\'clock had struck, and then, wearied and exhausted, ceased to contest\\r , the point any further.  With a caution, backed by many oaths, to make\\r , no more efforts to go out that night, Sikes left her to recover at\\r , leisure and rejoined Fagin.\\r , \\r , \\'Whew!\\' said the housebreaker wiping the perspiration from his face.\\r , \\'Wot a precious strange gal that is!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You may say that, Bill,\\' replied Fagin thoughtfully.  \\'You may say\\r , that.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Wot did she take it into her head to go out to-night for, do you\\r , think?\\' asked Sikes.  \\'Come; you should know her better than me. Wot\\r , does it mean?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Obstinacy; woman\\'s obstinacy, I suppose, my dear.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, I suppose it is,\\' growled Sikes.  \\'I thought I had tamed her,\\r , but she\\'s as bad as ever.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Worse,\\' said Fagin thoughtfully.  \\'I never knew her like this, for\\r , such a little cause.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nor I,\\' said Sikes.  \\'I think she\\'s got a touch of that fever in her\\r , blood yet, and it won\\'t come out--eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Like enough.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ll let her a little blood, without troubling the doctor, if she\\'s\\r , took that way again,\\' said Sikes.\\r , \\r , Fagin nodded an expressive approval of this mode of treatment.\\r , \\r , \\'She was hanging about me all day, and night too, when I was stretched\\r , on my back; and you, like a blackhearted wolf as you are, kept yourself\\r , aloof,\\' said Sikes.  \\'We was poor too, all the time, and I think, one\\r , way or other, it\\'s worried and fretted her; and that being shut up here\\r , so long has made her restless--eh?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s it, my dear,\\' replied the Jew in a whisper.  \\'Hush!\\'\\r , \\r , As he uttered these words, the girl herself appeared and resumed her\\r , former seat.  Her eyes were swollen and red; she rocked herself to and\\r , fro; tossed her head; and, after a little time, burst out laughing.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, now she\\'s on the other tack!\\' exclaimed Sikes, turning a look of\\r , excessive surprise on his companion.\\r , \\r , Fagin nodded to him to take no further notice just then; and, in a few\\r , minutes, the girl subsided into her accustomed demeanour. Whispering\\r , Sikes that there was no fear of her relapsing, Fagin took up his hat\\r , and bade him good-night.  He paused when he reached the room-door, and\\r , looking round, asked if somebody would light him down the dark stairs.\\r , \\r , \\'Light him down,\\' said Sikes, who was filling his pipe. \\'It\\'s a pity he\\r , should break his neck himself, and disappoint the sight-seers.  Show\\r , him a light.\\'\\r , \\r , Nancy followed the old man downstairs, with a candle.  When they\\r , reached the passage, he laid his finger on his lip, and drawing close\\r , to the girl, said, in a whisper.\\r , \\r , \\'What is it, Nancy, dear?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What do you mean?\\' replied the girl, in the same tone.\\r , \\r , \\'The reason of all this,\\' replied Fagin.  \\'If _he_\\'--he pointed with\\r , his skinny fore-finger up the stairs--\\'is so hard with you (he\\'s a\\r , brute, Nance, a brute-beast), why don\\'t you--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well?\\' said the girl, as Fagin paused, with his mouth almost touching\\r , her ear, and his eyes looking into hers.\\r , \\r , \\'No matter just now.  We\\'ll talk of this again.  You have a friend in\\r , me, Nance; a staunch friend.  I have the means at hand, quiet and\\r , close.  If you want revenge on those that treat you like a dog--like a\\r , dog!  worse than his dog, for he humours him sometimes--come to me.  I\\r , say, come to me.  He is the mere hound of a day, but you know me of\\r , old, Nance.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I know you well,\\' replied the girl, without manifesting the least\\r , emotion.  \\'Good-night.\\'\\r , \\r , She shrank back, as Fagin offered to lay his hand on hers, but said\\r , good-night again, in a steady voice, and, answering his parting look\\r , with a nod of intelligence, closed the door between them.\\r , \\r , Fagin walked towards his home, intent upon the thoughts that were\\r , working within his brain.  He had conceived the idea--not from what had\\r , just passed though that had tended to confirm him, but slowly and by\\r , degrees--that Nancy, wearied of the housebreaker\\'s brutality, had\\r , conceived an attachment for some new friend.  Her altered manner, her\\r , repeated absences from home alone, her comparative indifference to the\\r , interests of the gang for which she had once been so zealous, and,\\r , added to these, her desperate impatience to leave home that night at a\\r , particular hour, all favoured the supposition, and rendered it, to him\\r , at least, almost matter of certainty.  The object of this new liking\\r , was not among his myrmidons.  He would be a valuable acquisition with\\r , such an assistant as Nancy, and must (thus Fagin argued) be secured\\r , without delay.\\r , \\r , There was another, and a darker object, to be gained.  Sikes knew too\\r , much, and his ruffian taunts had not galled Fagin the less, because the\\r , wounds were hidden.  The girl must know, well, that if she shook him\\r , off, she could never be safe from his fury, and that it would be surely\\r , wreaked--to the maiming of limbs, or perhaps the loss of life--on the\\r , object of her more recent fancy.\\r , \\r , \\'With a little persuasion,\\' thought Fagin, \\'what more likely than that\\r , she would consent to poison him?  Women have done such things, and\\r , worse, to secure the same object before now.  There would be the\\r , dangerous villain:  the man I hate:  gone; another secured in his\\r , place; and my influence over the girl, with a knowledge of this crime\\r , to back it, unlimited.\\'\\r , \\r , These things passed through the mind of Fagin, during the short time he\\r , sat alone, in the housebreaker\\'s room; and with them uppermost in his\\r , thoughts, he had taken the opportunity afterwards afforded him, of\\r , sounding the girl in the broken hints he threw out at parting.  There\\r , was no expression of surprise, no assumption of an inability to\\r , understand his meaning.  The girl clearly comprehended it.  Her glance\\r , at parting showed _that_.\\r , \\r , But perhaps she would recoil from a plot to take the life of Sikes, and\\r , that was one of the chief ends to be attained. \\'How,\\' thought Fagin, as\\r , he crept homeward, \\'can I increase my influence with her?  What new\\r , power can I acquire?\\'\\r , \\r , Such brains are fertile in expedients.  If, without extracting a\\r , confession from herself, he laid a watch, discovered the object of her\\r , altered regard, and threatened to reveal the whole history to Sikes (of\\r , whom she stood in no common fear) unless she entered into his designs,\\r , could he not secure her compliance?\\r , \\r , \\'I can,\\' said Fagin, almost aloud.  \\'She durst not refuse me then.  Not\\r , for her life, not for her life!  I have it all.  The means are ready,\\r , and shall be set to work.  I shall have you yet!\\'\\r , \\r , He cast back a dark look, and a threatening motion of the hand, towards\\r , the spot where he had left the bolder villain; and went on his way:\\r , busying his bony hands in the folds of his tattered garment, which he\\r , wrenched tightly in his grasp, as though there were a hated enemy\\r , crushed with every motion of his fingers.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XLV\\r , \\r , NOAH CLAYPOLE IS EMPLOYED BY FAGIN ON A SECRET MISSION\\r , \\r , The old man was up, betimes, next morning, and waited impatiently for\\r , the appearance of his new associate, who after a delay that seemed\\r , interminable, at length presented himself, and commenced a voracious\\r , assault on the breakfast.\\r , \\r , \\'Bolter,\\' said Fagin, drawing up a chair and seating himself opposite\\r , Morris Bolter.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, here I am,\\' returned Noah.  \\'What\\'s the matter?  Don\\'t yer ask\\r , me to do anything till I have done eating. That\\'s a great fault in this\\r , place.  Yer never get time enough over yer meals.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You can talk as you eat, can\\'t you?\\' said Fagin, cursing his dear\\r , young friend\\'s greediness from the very bottom of his heart.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh yes, I can talk.  I get on better when I talk,\\' said Noah, cutting\\r , a monstrous slice of bread.  \\'Where\\'s Charlotte?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Out,\\' said Fagin.  \\'I sent her out this morning with the other young\\r , woman, because I wanted us to be alone.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh!\\' said Noah.  \\'I wish yer\\'d ordered her to make some buttered toast\\r , first.  Well.  Talk away.  Yer won\\'t interrupt me.\\'\\r , \\r , There seemed, indeed, no great fear of anything interrupting him, as he\\r , had evidently sat down with a determination to do a great deal of\\r , business.\\r , \\r , \\'You did well yesterday, my dear,\\' said Fagin.  \\'Beautiful!  Six\\r , shillings and ninepence halfpenny on the very first day!  The kinchin\\r , lay will be a fortune to you.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t you forget to add three pint-pots and a milk-can,\\' said Mr.\\r , Bolter.\\r , \\r , \\'No, no, my dear.  The pint-pots were great strokes of genius: but the\\r , milk-can was a perfect masterpiece.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Pretty well, I think, for a beginner,\\' remarked Mr. Bolter\\r , complacently.  \\'The pots I took off airy railings, and the milk-can was\\r , standing by itself outside a public-house.  I thought it might get\\r , rusty with the rain, or catch cold, yer know.  Eh?  Ha! ha! ha!\\'\\r , \\r , Fagin affected to laugh very heartily; and Mr. Bolter having had his\\r , laugh out, took a series of large bites, which finished his first hunk\\r , of bread and butter, and assisted himself to a second.\\r , \\r , \\'I want you, Bolter,\\' said Fagin, leaning over the table, \\'to do a\\r , piece of work for me, my dear, that needs great care and caution.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I say,\\' rejoined Bolter, \\'don\\'t yer go shoving me into danger, or\\r , sending me any more o\\' yer police-offices. That don\\'t suit me, that\\r , don\\'t; and so I tell yer.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s not the smallest danger in it--not the very smallest,\\' said the\\r , Jew; \\'it\\'s only to dodge a woman.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'An old woman?\\' demanded Mr. Bolter.\\r , \\r , \\'A young one,\\' replied Fagin.\\r , \\r , \\'I can do that pretty well, I know,\\' said Bolter.  \\'I was a regular\\r , cunning sneak when I was at school.  What am I to dodge her for?  Not\\r , to--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not to do anything, but to tell me where she goes, who she sees, and,\\r , if possible, what she says; to remember the street, if it is a street,\\r , or the house, if it is a house; and to bring me back all the\\r , information you can.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'ll yer give me?\\' asked Noah, setting down his cup, and looking\\r , his employer, eagerly, in the face.\\r , \\r , \\'If you do it well, a pound, my dear.  One pound,\\' said Fagin, wishing\\r , to interest him in the scent as much as possible.  \\'And that\\'s what I\\r , never gave yet, for any job of work where there wasn\\'t valuable\\r , consideration to be gained.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Who is she?\\' inquired Noah.\\r , \\r , \\'One of us.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh Lor!\\' cried Noah, curling up his nose.  \\'Yer doubtful of her, are\\r , yer?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'She has found out some new friends, my dear, and I must know who they\\r , are,\\' replied Fagin.\\r , \\r , \\'I see,\\' said Noah.  \\'Just to have the pleasure of knowing them, if\\r , they\\'re respectable people, eh?  Ha! ha! ha! I\\'m your man.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I knew you would be,\\' cried Fagin, elated by the success of his\\r , proposal.\\r , \\r , \\'Of course, of course,\\' replied Noah.  \\'Where is she? Where am I to\\r , wait for her?  Where am I to go?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'All that, my dear, you shall hear from me.  I\\'ll point her out at the\\r , proper time,\\' said Fagin.  \\'You keep ready, and leave the rest to me.\\'\\r , \\r , That night, and the next, and the next again, the spy sat booted and\\r , equipped in his carter\\'s dress:  ready to turn out at a word from\\r , Fagin.  Six nights passed--six long weary nights--and on each, Fagin\\r , came home with a disappointed face, and briefly intimated that it was\\r , not yet time.  On the seventh, he returned earlier, and with an\\r , exultation he could not conceal.  It was Sunday.\\r , \\r , \\'She goes abroad to-night,\\' said Fagin, \\'and on the right errand, I\\'m\\r , sure; for she has been alone all day, and the man she is afraid of will\\r , not be back much before daybreak.  Come with me. Quick!\\'\\r , \\r , Noah started up without saying a word; for the Jew was in a state of\\r , such intense excitement that it infected him.  They left the house\\r , stealthily, and hurrying through a labyrinth of streets, arrived at\\r , length before a public-house, which Noah recognised as the same in\\r , which he had slept, on the night of his arrival in London.\\r , \\r , It was past eleven o\\'clock, and the door was closed.  It opened softly\\r , on its hinges as Fagin gave a low whistle. They entered, without noise;\\r , and the door was closed behind them.\\r , \\r , Scarcely venturing to whisper, but substituting dumb show for words,\\r , Fagin, and the young Jew who had admitted them, pointed out the pane of\\r , glass to Noah, and signed to him to climb up and observe the person in\\r , the adjoining room.\\r , \\r , \\'Is that the woman?\\' he asked, scarcely above his breath.\\r , \\r , Fagin nodded yes.\\r , \\r , \\'I can\\'t see her face well,\\' whispered Noah.  \\'She is looking down, and\\r , the candle is behind her.\\r , \\r , \\'Stay there,\\' whispered Fagin.  He signed to Barney, who withdrew.  In\\r , an instant, the lad entered the room adjoining, and, under pretence of\\r , snuffing the candle, moved it in the required position, and, speaking\\r , to the girl, caused her to raise her face.\\r , \\r , \\'I see her now,\\' cried the spy.\\r , \\r , \\'Plainly?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I should know her among a thousand.\\'\\r , \\r , He hastily descended, as the room-door opened, and the girl came out.\\r , Fagin drew him behind a small partition which was curtained off, and\\r , they held their breaths as she passed within a few feet of their place\\r , of concealment, and emerged by the door at which they had entered.\\r , \\r , \\'Hist!\\' cried the lad who held the door.  \\'Dow.\\'\\r , \\r , Noah exchanged a look with Fagin, and darted out.\\r , \\r , \\'To the left,\\' whispered the lad; \\'take the left had, and keep od the\\r , other side.\\'\\r , \\r , He did so; and, by the light of the lamps, saw the girl\\'s retreating\\r , figure, already at some distance before him.  He advanced as near as he\\r , considered prudent, and kept on the opposite side of the street, the\\r , better to observe her motions. She looked nervously round, twice or\\r , thrice, and once stopped to let two men who were following close behind\\r , her, pass on.  She seemed to gather courage as she advanced, and to\\r , walk with a steadier and firmer step.  The spy preserved the same\\r , relative distance between them, and followed:  with his eye upon her.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XLVI\\r , \\r , THE APPOINTMENT KEPT\\r , \\r , The church clocks chimed three quarters past eleven, as two figures\\r , emerged on London Bridge.  One, which advanced with a swift and rapid\\r , step, was that of a woman who looked eagerly about her as though in\\r , quest of some expected object; the other figure was that of a man, who\\r , slunk along in the deepest shadow he could find, and, at some distance,\\r , accommodated his pace to hers:  stopping when she stopped:  and as she\\r , moved again, creeping stealthily on:  but never allowing himself, in\\r , the ardour of his pursuit, to gain upon her footsteps.  Thus, they\\r , crossed the bridge, from the Middlesex to the Surrey shore, when the\\r , woman, apparently disappointed in her anxious scrutiny of the\\r , foot-passengers, turned back.  The movement was sudden; but he who\\r , watched her, was not thrown off his guard by it; for, shrinking into\\r , one of the recesses which surmount the piers of the bridge, and leaning\\r , over the parapet the better to conceal his figure, he suffered her to\\r , pass on the opposite pavement. When she was about the same distance in\\r , advance as she had been before, he slipped quietly down, and followed\\r , her again. At nearly the centre of the bridge, she stopped.  The man\\r , stopped too.\\r , \\r , It was a very dark night.  The day had been unfavourable, and at that\\r , hour and place there were few people stirring. Such as there were,\\r , hurried quickly past:  very possibly without seeing, but certainly\\r , without noticing, either the woman, or the man who kept her in view.\\r , Their appearance was not calculated to attract the importunate regards\\r , of such of London\\'s destitute population, as chanced to take their way\\r , over the bridge that night in search of some cold arch or doorless\\r , hovel wherein to lay their heads; they stood there in silence:  neither\\r , speaking nor spoken to, by any one who passed.\\r , \\r , A mist hung over the river, deepening the red glare of the fires that\\r , burnt upon the small craft moored off the different wharfs, and\\r , rendering darker and more indistinct the murky buildings on the banks.\\r , The old smoke-stained storehouses on either side, rose heavy and dull\\r , from the dense mass of roofs and gables, and frowned sternly upon water\\r , too black to reflect even their lumbering shapes. The tower of old\\r , Saint Saviour\\'s Church, and the spire of Saint Magnus, so long the\\r , giant-warders of the ancient bridge, were visible in the gloom; but the\\r , forest of shipping below bridge, and the thickly scattered spires of\\r , churches above, were nearly all hidden from sight.\\r , \\r , The girl had taken a few restless turns to and fro--closely watched\\r , meanwhile by her hidden observer--when the heavy bell of St. Paul\\'s\\r , tolled for the death of another day.  Midnight had come upon the\\r , crowded city.  The palace, the night-cellar, the jail, the madhouse:\\r , the chambers of birth and death, of health and sickness, the rigid face\\r , of the corpse and the calm sleep of the child:  midnight was upon them\\r , all.\\r , \\r , The hour had not struck two minutes, when a young lady, accompanied by\\r , a grey-haired gentleman, alighted from a hackney-carriage within a\\r , short distance of the bridge, and, having dismissed the vehicle, walked\\r , straight towards it.  They had scarcely set foot upon its pavement,\\r , when the girl started, and immediately made towards them.\\r , \\r , They walked onward, looking about them with the air of persons who\\r , entertained some very slight expectation which had little chance of\\r , being realised, when they were suddenly joined by this new associate.\\r , They halted with an exclamation of surprise, but suppressed it\\r , immediately; for a man in the garments of a countryman came close\\r , up--brushed against them, indeed--at that precise moment.\\r , \\r , \\'Not here,\\' said Nancy hurriedly, \\'I am afraid to speak to you here.\\r , Come away--out of the public road--down the steps yonder!\\'\\r , \\r , As she uttered these words, and indicated, with her hand, the direction\\r , in which she wished them to proceed, the countryman looked round, and\\r , roughly asking what they took up the whole pavement for, passed on.\\r , \\r , The steps to which the girl had pointed, were those which, on the\\r , Surrey bank, and on the same side of the bridge as Saint Saviour\\'s\\r , Church, form a landing-stairs from the river.  To this spot, the man\\r , bearing the appearance of a countryman, hastened unobserved; and after\\r , a moment\\'s survey of the place, he began to descend.\\r , \\r , These stairs are a part of the bridge; they consist of three flights.\\r , Just below the end of the second, going down, the stone wall on the\\r , left terminates in an ornamental pilaster facing towards the Thames.\\r , At this point the lower steps widen:  so that a person turning that\\r , angle of the wall, is necessarily unseen by any others on the stairs\\r , who chance to be above him, if only a step. The countryman looked\\r , hastily round, when he reached this point; and as there seemed no\\r , better place of concealment, and, the tide being out, there was plenty\\r , of room, he slipped aside, with his back to the pilaster, and there\\r , waited:  pretty certain that they would come no lower, and that even if\\r , he could not hear what was said, he could follow them again, with\\r , safety.\\r , \\r , So tardily stole the time in this lonely place, and so eager was the\\r , spy to penetrate the motives of an interview so different from what he\\r , had been led to expect, that he more than once gave the matter up for\\r , lost, and persuaded himself, either that they had stopped far above, or\\r , had resorted to some entirely different spot to hold their mysterious\\r , conversation.  He was on the point of emerging from his hiding-place,\\r , and regaining the road above, when he heard the sound of footsteps, and\\r , directly afterwards of voices almost close at his ear.\\r , \\r , He drew himself straight upright against the wall, and, scarcely\\r , breathing, listened attentively.\\r , \\r , \\'This is far enough,\\' said a voice, which was evidently that of the\\r , gentleman.  \\'I will not suffer the young lady to go any farther.  Many\\r , people would have distrusted you too much to have come even so far, but\\r , you see I am willing to humour you.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'To humour me!\\' cried the voice of the girl whom he had followed.\\r , \\'You\\'re considerate, indeed, sir.  To humour me!  Well, well, it\\'s no\\r , matter.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why, for what,\\' said the gentleman in a kinder tone, \\'for what purpose\\r , can you have brought us to this strange place?  Why not have let me\\r , speak to you, above there, where it is light, and there is something\\r , stirring, instead of bringing us to this dark and dismal hole?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I told you before,\\' replied Nancy, \\'that I was afraid to speak to you\\r , there.  I don\\'t know why it is,\\' said the girl, shuddering, \\'but I have\\r , such a fear and dread upon me to-night that I can hardly stand.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'A fear of what?\\' asked the gentleman, who seemed to pity her.\\r , \\r , \\'I scarcely know of what,\\' replied the girl.  \\'I wish I did. Horrible\\r , thoughts of death, and shrouds with blood upon them, and a fear that\\r , has made me burn as if I was on fire, have been upon me all day.  I was\\r , reading a book to-night, to wile the time away, and the same things\\r , came into the print.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Imagination,\\' said the gentleman, soothing her.\\r , \\r , \\'No imagination,\\' replied the girl in a hoarse voice. \\'I\\'ll swear I saw\\r , \"coffin\" written in every page of the book in large black\\r , letters,--aye, and they carried one close to me, in the streets\\r , to-night.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'There is nothing unusual in that,\\' said the gentleman. \\'They have\\r , passed me often.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'_Real ones_,\\' rejoined the girl.  \\'This was not.\\'\\r , \\r , There was something so uncommon in her manner, that the flesh of the\\r , concealed listener crept as he heard the girl utter these words, and\\r , the blood chilled within him.  He had never experienced a greater\\r , relief than in hearing the sweet voice of the young lady as she begged\\r , her to be calm, and not allow herself to become the prey of such\\r , fearful fancies.\\r , \\r , \\'Speak to her kindly,\\' said the young lady to her companion. \\'Poor\\r , creature!  She seems to need it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Your haughty religious people would have held their heads up to see me\\r , as I am to-night, and preached of flames and vengeance,\\' cried the\\r , girl.  \\'Oh, dear lady, why ar\\'n\\'t those who claim to be God\\'s own folks\\r , as gentle and as kind to us poor wretches as you, who, having youth,\\r , and beauty, and all that they have lost, might be a little proud\\r , instead of so much humbler?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Ah!\\' said the gentleman.  \\'A Turk turns his face, after washing it\\r , well, to the East, when he says his prayers; these good people, after\\r , giving their faces such a rub against the World as to take the smiles\\r , off, turn with no less regularity, to the darkest side of Heaven.\\r , Between the Mussulman and the Pharisee, commend me to the first!\\'\\r , \\r , These words appeared to be addressed to the young lady, and were\\r , perhaps uttered with the view of affording Nancy time to recover\\r , herself.  The gentleman, shortly afterwards, addressed himself to her.\\r , \\r , \\'You were not here last Sunday night,\\' he said.\\r , \\r , \\'I couldn\\'t come,\\' replied Nancy; \\'I was kept by force.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'By whom?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Him that I told the young lady of before.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You were not suspected of holding any communication with anybody on\\r , the subject which has brought us here to-night, I hope?\\' asked the old\\r , gentleman.\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' replied the girl, shaking her head.  \\'It\\'s not very easy for me\\r , to leave him unless he knows why; I couldn\\'t give him a drink of\\r , laudanum before I came away.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Did he awake before you returned?\\' inquired the gentleman.\\r , \\r , \\'No; and neither he nor any of them suspect me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Good,\\' said the gentleman.  \\'Now listen to me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I am ready,\\' replied the girl, as he paused for a moment.\\r , \\r , \\'This young lady,\\' the gentleman began, \\'has communicated to me, and to\\r , some other friends who can be safely trusted, what you told her nearly\\r , a fortnight since.  I confess to you that I had doubts, at first,\\r , whether you were to be implicitly relied upon, but now I firmly believe\\r , you are.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I am,\\' said the girl earnestly.\\r , \\r , \\'I repeat that I firmly believe it.  To prove to you that I am disposed\\r , to trust you, I tell you without reserve, that we propose to extort the\\r , secret, whatever it may be, from the fear of this man Monks.  But\\r , if--if--\\' said the gentleman, \\'he cannot be secured, or, if secured,\\r , cannot be acted upon as we wish, you must deliver up the Jew.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Fagin,\\' cried the girl, recoiling.\\r , \\r , \\'That man must be delivered up by you,\\' said the gentleman.\\r , \\r , \\'I will not do it!  I will never do it!\\' replied the girl. \\'Devil that\\r , he is, and worse than devil as he has been to me, I will never do that.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You will not?\\' said the gentleman, who seemed fully prepared for this\\r , answer.\\r , \\r , \\'Never!\\' returned the girl.\\r , \\r , \\'Tell me why?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'For one reason,\\' rejoined the girl firmly, \\'for one reason, that the\\r , lady knows and will stand by me in, I know she will, for I have her\\r , promise:  and for this other reason, besides, that, bad life as he has\\r , led, I have led a bad life too; there are many of us who have kept the\\r , same courses together, and I\\'ll not turn upon them, who might--any of\\r , them--have turned upon me, but didn\\'t, bad as they are.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then,\\' said the gentleman, quickly, as if this had been the point he\\r , had been aiming to attain; \\'put Monks into my hands, and leave him to\\r , me to deal with.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What if he turns against the others?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I promise you that in that case, if the truth is forced from him,\\r , there the matter will rest; there must be circumstances in Oliver\\'s\\r , little history which it would be painful to drag before the public eye,\\r , and if the truth is once elicited, they shall go scot free.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And if it is not?\\' suggested the girl.\\r , \\r , \\'Then,\\' pursued the gentleman, \\'this Fagin shall not be brought to\\r , justice without your consent.  In such a case I could show you reasons,\\r , I think, which would induce you to yield it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Have I the lady\\'s promise for that?\\' asked the girl.\\r , \\r , \\'You have,\\' replied Rose.  \\'My true and faithful pledge.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Monks would never learn how you knew what you do?\\' said the girl,\\r , after a short pause.\\r , \\r , \\'Never,\\' replied the gentleman.  \\'The intelligence should be brought to\\r , bear upon him, that he could never even guess.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I have been a liar, and among liars from a little child,\\' said the\\r , girl after another interval of silence, \\'but I will take your words.\\'\\r , \\r , After receiving an assurance from both, that she might safely do so,\\r , she proceeded in a voice so low that it was often difficult for the\\r , listener to discover even the purport of what she said, to describe, by\\r , name and situation, the public-house whence she had been followed that\\r , night.  From the manner in which she occasionally paused, it appeared\\r , as if the gentleman were making some hasty notes of the information she\\r , communicated.  When she had thoroughly explained the localities of the\\r , place, the best position from which to watch it without exciting\\r , observation, and the night and hour on which Monks was most in the\\r , habit of frequenting it, she seemed to consider for a few moments, for\\r , the purpose of recalling his features and appearances more forcibly to\\r , her recollection.\\r , \\r , \\'He is tall,\\' said the girl, \\'and a strongly made man, but not stout;\\r , he has a lurking walk; and as he walks, constantly looks over his\\r , shoulder, first on one side, and then on the other. Don\\'t forget that,\\r , for his eyes are sunk in his head so much deeper than any other man\\'s,\\r , that you might almost tell him by that alone.  His face is dark, like\\r , his hair and eyes; and, although he can\\'t be more than six or eight and\\r , twenty, withered and haggard. His lips are often discoloured and\\r , disfigured with the marks of teeth; for he has desperate fits, and\\r , sometimes even bites his hands and covers them with wounds--why did you\\r , start?\\' said the girl, stopping suddenly.\\r , \\r , The gentleman replied, in a hurried manner, that he was not conscious\\r , of having done so, and begged her to proceed.\\r , \\r , \\'Part of this,\\' said the girl, \\'I have drawn out from other people at\\r , the house I tell you of, for I have only seen him twice, and both times\\r , he was covered up in a large cloak.  I think that\\'s all I can give you\\r , to know him by.  Stay though,\\' she added.  \\'Upon his throat:  so high\\r , that you can see a part of it below his neckerchief when he turns his\\r , face:  there is--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'A broad red mark, like a burn or scald?\\' cried the gentleman.\\r , \\r , \\'How\\'s this?\\' said the girl.  \\'You know him!\\'\\r , \\r , The young lady uttered a cry of surprise, and for a few moments they\\r , were so still that the listener could distinctly hear them breathe.\\r , \\r , \\'I think I do,\\' said the gentleman, breaking silence.  \\'I should by\\r , your description.  We shall see.  Many people are singularly like each\\r , other.  It may not be the same.\\'\\r , \\r , As he expressed himself to this effect, with assumed carelessness, he\\r , took a step or two nearer the concealed spy, as the latter could tell\\r , from the distinctness with which he heard him mutter, \\'It must be he!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Now,\\' he said, returning:  so it seemed by the sound:  to the spot\\r , where he had stood before, \\'you have given us most valuable assistance,\\r , young woman, and I wish you to be the better for it. What can I do to\\r , serve you?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing,\\' replied Nancy.\\r , \\r , \\'You will not persist in saying that,\\' rejoined the gentleman, with a\\r , voice and emphasis of kindness that might have touched a much harder\\r , and more obdurate heart. \\'Think now.  Tell me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing, sir,\\' rejoined the girl, weeping.  \\'You can do nothing to\\r , help me.  I am past all hope, indeed.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You put yourself beyond its pale,\\' said the gentleman. \\'The past has\\r , been a dreary waste with you, of youthful energies mis-spent, and such\\r , priceless treasures lavished, as the Creator bestows but once and never\\r , grants again, but, for the future, you may hope. I do not say that it\\r , is in our power to offer you peace of heart and mind, for that must\\r , come as you seek it; but a quiet asylum, either in England, or, if you\\r , fear to remain here, in some foreign country, it is not only within the\\r , compass of our ability but our most anxious wish to secure you. Before\\r , the dawn of morning, before this river wakes to the first glimpse of\\r , day-light, you shall be placed as entirely beyond the reach of your\\r , former associates, and leave as utter an absence of all trace behind\\r , you, as if you were to disappear from the earth this moment.  Come!  I\\r , would not have you go back to exchange one word with any old companion,\\r , or take one look at any old haunt, or breathe the very air which is\\r , pestilence and death to you.  Quit them all, while there is time and\\r , opportunity!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'She will be persuaded now,\\' cried the young lady.  \\'She hesitates, I\\r , am sure.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I fear not, my dear,\\' said the gentleman.\\r , \\r , \\'No sir, I do not,\\' replied the girl, after a short struggle.  \\'I am\\r , chained to my old life.  I loathe and hate it now, but I cannot leave\\r , it.  I must have gone too far to turn back,--and yet I don\\'t know, for\\r , if you had spoken to me so, some time ago, I should have laughed it\\r , off.  But,\\' she said, looking hastily round, \\'this fear comes over me\\r , again.  I must go home.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Home!\\' repeated the young lady, with great stress upon the word.\\r , \\r , \\'Home, lady,\\' rejoined the girl.  \\'To such a home as I have raised for\\r , myself with the work of my whole life.  Let us part. I shall be watched\\r , or seen.  Go!  Go!  If I have done you any service all I ask is, that\\r , you leave me, and let me go my way alone.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It is useless,\\' said the gentleman, with a sigh.  \\'We compromise her\\r , safety, perhaps, by staying here.  We may have detained her longer than\\r , she expected already.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, yes,\\' urged the girl. \\'You have.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What,\\' cried the young lady, \\'can be the end of this poor creature\\'s\\r , life!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What!\\' repeated the girl.  \\'Look before you, lady.  Look at that dark\\r , water.  How many times do you read of such as I who spring into the\\r , tide, and leave no living thing, to care for, or bewail them.  It may\\r , be years hence, or it may be only months, but I shall come to that at\\r , last.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Do not speak thus, pray,\\' returned the young lady, sobbing.\\r , \\r , \\'It will never reach your ears, dear lady, and God forbid such horrors\\r , should!\\' replied the girl.  \\'Good-night, good-night!\\'\\r , \\r , The gentleman turned away.\\r , \\r , \\'This purse,\\' cried the young lady.  \\'Take it for my sake, that you may\\r , have some resource in an hour of need and trouble.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No!\\' replied the girl.  \\'I have not done this for money.  Let me have\\r , that to think of.  And yet--give me something that you have worn:  I\\r , should like to have something--no, no, not a ring--your gloves or\\r , handkerchief--anything that I can keep, as having belonged to you,\\r , sweet lady.  There.  Bless you!  God bless you. Good-night, good-night!\\'\\r , \\r , The violent agitation of the girl, and the apprehension of some\\r , discovery which would subject her to ill-usage and violence, seemed to\\r , determine the gentleman to leave her, as she requested.\\r , \\r , The sound of retreating footsteps were audible and the voices ceased.\\r , \\r , The two figures of the young lady and her companion soon afterwards\\r , appeared upon the bridge.  They stopped at the summit of the stairs.\\r , \\r , \\'Hark!\\' cried the young lady, listening.  \\'Did she call!  I thought I\\r , heard her voice.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, my love,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow, looking sadly back. \\'She has not\\r , moved, and will not till we are gone.\\'\\r , \\r , Rose Maylie lingered, but the old gentleman drew her arm through his,\\r , and led her, with gentle force, away.  As they disappeared, the girl\\r , sunk down nearly at her full length upon one of the stone stairs, and\\r , vented the anguish of her heart in bitter tears.\\r , \\r , After a time she arose, and with feeble and tottering steps ascended\\r , the street.  The astonished listener remained motionless on his post\\r , for some minutes afterwards, and having ascertained, with many cautious\\r , glances round him, that he was again alone, crept slowly from his\\r , hiding-place, and returned, stealthily and in the shade of the wall, in\\r , the same manner as he had descended.\\r , \\r , Peeping out, more than once, when he reached the top, to make sure that\\r , he was unobserved, Noah Claypole darted away at his utmost speed, and\\r , made for the Jew\\'s house as fast as his legs would carry him.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XLVII\\r , \\r , FATAL CONSEQUENCES\\r , \\r , It was nearly two hours before day-break; that time which in the autumn\\r , of the year, may be truly called the dead of night; when the streets\\r , are silent and deserted; when even sounds appear to slumber, and\\r , profligacy and riot have staggered home to dream; it was at this still\\r , and silent hour, that Fagin sat watching in his old lair, with face so\\r , distorted and pale, and eyes so red and blood-shot, that he looked less\\r , like a man, than like some hideous phantom, moist from the grave, and\\r , worried by an evil spirit.\\r , \\r , He sat crouching over a cold hearth, wrapped in an old torn coverlet,\\r , with his face turned towards a wasting candle that stood upon a table\\r , by his side.  His right hand was raised to his lips, and as, absorbed\\r , in thought, he hit his long black nails, he disclosed among his\\r , toothless gums a few such fangs as should have been a dog\\'s or rat\\'s.\\r , \\r , Stretched upon a mattress on the floor, lay Noah Claypole, fast asleep.\\r , Towards him the old man sometimes directed his eyes for an instant, and\\r , then brought them back again to the candle; which with a long-burnt\\r , wick drooping almost double, and hot grease falling down in clots upon\\r , the table, plainly showed that his thoughts were busy elsewhere.\\r , \\r , Indeed they were.  Mortification at the overthrow of his notable\\r , scheme; hatred of the girl who had dared to palter with strangers; and\\r , utter distrust of the sincerity of her refusal to yield him up; bitter\\r , disappointment at the loss of his revenge on Sikes; the fear of\\r , detection, and ruin, and death; and a fierce and deadly rage kindled by\\r , all; these were the passionate considerations which, following close\\r , upon each other with rapid and ceaseless whirl, shot through the brain\\r , of Fagin, as every evil thought and blackest purpose lay working at his\\r , heart.\\r , \\r , He sat without changing his attitude in the least, or appearing to take\\r , the smallest heed of time, until his quick ear seemed to be attracted\\r , by a footstep in the street.\\r , \\r , \\'At last,\\' he muttered, wiping his dry and fevered mouth. \\'At last!\\'\\r , \\r , The bell rang gently as he spoke.  He crept upstairs to the door, and\\r , presently returned accompanied by a man muffled to the chin, who\\r , carried a bundle under one arm. Sitting down and throwing back his\\r , outer coat, the man displayed the burly frame of Sikes.\\r , \\r , \\'There!\\' he said, laying the bundle on the table.  \\'Take care of that,\\r , and do the most you can with it.  It\\'s been trouble enough to get; I\\r , thought I should have been here, three hours ago.\\'\\r , \\r , Fagin laid his hand upon the bundle, and locking it in the cupboard,\\r , sat down again without speaking.  But he did not take his eyes off the\\r , robber, for an instant, during this action; and now that they sat over\\r , against each other, face to face, he looked fixedly at him, with his\\r , lips quivering so violently, and his face so altered by the emotions\\r , which had mastered him, that the housebreaker involuntarily drew back\\r , his chair, and surveyed him with a look of real affright.\\r , \\r , \\'Wot now?\\' cried Sikes.  \\'Wot do you look at a man so for?\\'\\r , \\r , Fagin raised his right hand, and shook his trembling forefinger in the\\r , air; but his passion was so great, that the power of speech was for the\\r , moment gone.\\r , \\r , \\'Damme!\\' said Sikes, feeling in his breast with a look of alarm. \\'He\\'s\\r , gone mad.  I must look to myself here.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, no,\\' rejoined Fagin, finding his voice.  \\'It\\'s not--you\\'re not the\\r , person, Bill.  I\\'ve no--no fault to find with you.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, you haven\\'t, haven\\'t you?\\' said Sikes, looking sternly at him, and\\r , ostentatiously passing a pistol into a more convenient pocket.  \\'That\\'s\\r , lucky--for one of us.  Which one that is, don\\'t matter.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ve got that to tell you, Bill,\\' said Fagin, drawing his chair\\r , nearer, \\'will make you worse than me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Aye?\\' returned the robber with an incredulous air.  \\'Tell away! Look\\r , sharp, or Nance will think I\\'m lost.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Lost!\\' cried Fagin.  \\'She has pretty well settled that, in her own\\r , mind, already.\\'\\r , \\r , Sikes looked with an aspect of great perplexity into the Jew\\'s face,\\r , and reading no satisfactory explanation of the riddle there, clenched\\r , his coat collar in his huge hand and shook him soundly.\\r , \\r , \\'Speak, will you!\\' he said; \\'or if you don\\'t, it shall be for want of\\r , breath.  Open your mouth and say wot you\\'ve got to say in plain words.\\r , Out with it, you thundering old cur, out with it!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Suppose that lad that\\'s laying there--\\' Fagin began.\\r , \\r , Sikes turned round to where Noah was sleeping, as if he had not\\r , previously observed him.  \\'Well!\\' he said, resuming his former position.\\r , \\r , \\'Suppose that lad,\\' pursued Fagin, \\'was to peach--to blow upon us\\r , all--first seeking out the right folks for the purpose, and then having\\r , a meeting with \\'em in the street to paint our likenesses, describe\\r , every mark that they might know us by, and the crib where we might be\\r , most easily taken.  Suppose he was to do all this, and besides to blow\\r , upon a plant we\\'ve all been in, more or less--of his own fancy; not\\r , grabbed, trapped, tried, earwigged by the parson and brought to it on\\r , bread and water,--but of his own fancy; to please his own taste;\\r , stealing out at nights to find those most interested against us, and\\r , peaching to them.  Do you hear me?\\' cried the Jew, his eyes flashing\\r , with rage.  \\'Suppose he did all this, what then?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What then!\\' replied Sikes; with a tremendous oath.  \\'If he was left\\r , alive till I came, I\\'d grind his skull under the iron heel of my boot\\r , into as many grains as there are hairs upon his head.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What if I did it!\\' cried Fagin almost in a yell.  \\'I, that knows so\\r , much, and could hang so many besides myself!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t know,\\' replied Sikes, clenching his teeth and turning white at\\r , the mere suggestion.  \\'I\\'d do something in the jail that \\'ud get me put\\r , in irons; and if I was tried along with you, I\\'d fall upon you with\\r , them in the open court, and beat your brains out afore the people. I\\r , should have such strength,\\' muttered the robber, poising his brawny\\r , arm, \\'that I could smash your head as if a loaded waggon had gone over\\r , it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You would?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Would I!\\' said the housebreaker.  \\'Try me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If it was Charley, or the Dodger, or Bet, or--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t care who,\\' replied Sikes impatiently.  \\'Whoever it was, I\\'d\\r , serve them the same.\\'\\r , \\r , Fagin looked hard at the robber; and, motioning him to be silent,\\r , stooped over the bed upon the floor, and shook the sleeper to rouse\\r , him.  Sikes leant forward in his chair:  looking on with his hands upon\\r , his knees, as if wondering much what all this questioning and\\r , preparation was to end in.\\r , \\r , \\'Bolter, Bolter!  Poor lad!\\' said Fagin, looking up with an expression\\r , of devilish anticipation, and speaking slowly and with marked emphasis.\\r , \\'He\\'s tired--tired with watching for her so long,--watching for _her_,\\r , Bill.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Wot d\\'ye mean?\\' asked Sikes, drawing back.\\r , \\r , Fagin made no answer, but bending over the sleeper again, hauled him\\r , into a sitting posture.  When his assumed name had been repeated\\r , several times, Noah rubbed his eyes, and, giving a heavy yawn, looked\\r , sleepily about him.\\r , \\r , \\'Tell me that again--once again, just for him to hear,\\' said the Jew,\\r , pointing to Sikes as he spoke.\\r , \\r , \\'Tell yer what?\\' asked the sleepy Noah, shaking himself pettishly.\\r , \\r , \\'That about-- _Nancy_,\\' said Fagin, clutching Sikes by the wrist, as if\\r , to prevent his leaving the house before he had heard enough. \\'You\\r , followed her?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'To London Bridge?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Where she met two people.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'So she did.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'A gentleman and a lady that she had gone to of her own accord before,\\r , who asked her to give up all her pals, and Monks first, which she\\r , did--and to describe him, which she did--and to tell her what house it\\r , was that we meet at, and go to, which she did--and where it could be\\r , best watched from, which she did--and what time the people went there,\\r , which she did.  She did all this.  She told it all every word without a\\r , threat, without a murmur--she did--did she not?\\' cried Fagin, half mad\\r , with fury.\\r , \\r , \\'All right,\\' replied Noah, scratching his head.  \\'That\\'s just what it\\r , was!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What did they say, about last Sunday?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'About last Sunday!\\' replied Noah, considering.  \\'Why I told yer that\\r , before.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Again.  Tell it again!\\' cried Fagin, tightening his grasp on Sikes,\\r , and brandishing his other hand aloft, as the foam flew from his lips.\\r , \\r , \\'They asked her,\\' said Noah, who, as he grew more wakeful, seemed to\\r , have a dawning perception who Sikes was, \\'they asked her why she didn\\'t\\r , come, last Sunday, as she promised.  She said she couldn\\'t.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why--why?  Tell him that.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Because she was forcibly kept at home by Bill, the man she had told\\r , them of before,\\' replied Noah.\\r , \\r , \\'What more of him?\\' cried Fagin.  \\'What more of the man she had told\\r , them of before?  Tell him that, tell him that.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why, that she couldn\\'t very easily get out of doors unless he knew\\r , where she was going to,\\' said Noah; \\'and so the first time she went to\\r , see the lady, she--ha! ha! ha! it made me laugh when she said it, that\\r , it did--she gave him a drink of laudanum.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hell\\'s fire!\\' cried Sikes, breaking fiercely from the Jew.  \\'Let me\\r , go!\\'\\r , \\r , Flinging the old man from him, he rushed from the room, and darted,\\r , wildly and furiously, up the stairs.\\r , \\r , \\'Bill, Bill!\\' cried Fagin, following him hastily.  \\'A word. Only a\\r , word.\\'\\r , \\r , The word would not have been exchanged, but that the housebreaker was\\r , unable to open the door:  on which he was expending fruitless oaths and\\r , violence, when the Jew came panting up.\\r , \\r , \\'Let me out,\\' said Sikes.  \\'Don\\'t speak to me; it\\'s not safe. Let me\\r , out, I say!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hear me speak a word,\\' rejoined Fagin, laying his hand upon the lock.\\r , \\'You won\\'t be--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well,\\' replied the other.\\r , \\r , \\'You won\\'t be--too--violent, Bill?\\'\\r , \\r , The day was breaking, and there was light enough for the men to see\\r , each other\\'s faces.  They exchanged one brief glance; there was a fire\\r , in the eyes of both, which could not be mistaken.\\r , \\r , \\'I mean,\\' said Fagin, showing that he felt all disguise was now\\r , useless, \\'not too violent for safety.  Be crafty, Bill, and not too\\r , bold.\\'\\r , \\r , Sikes made no reply; but, pulling open the door, of which Fagin had\\r , turned the lock, dashed into the silent streets.\\r , \\r , Without one pause, or moment\\'s consideration; without once turning his\\r , head to the right or left, or raising his eyes to the sky, or lowering\\r , them to the ground, but looking straight before him with savage\\r , resolution:  his teeth so tightly compressed that the strained jaw\\r , seemed starting through his skin; the robber held on his headlong\\r , course, nor muttered a word, nor relaxed a muscle, until he reached his\\r , own door.  He opened it, softly, with a key; strode lightly up the\\r , stairs; and entering his own room, double-locked the door, and lifting\\r , a heavy table against it, drew back the curtain of the bed.\\r , \\r , The girl was lying, half-dressed, upon it.  He had roused her from her\\r , sleep, for she raised herself with a hurried and startled look.\\r , \\r , \\'Get up!\\' said the man.\\r , \\r , \\'It is you, Bill!\\' said the girl, with an expression of pleasure at his\\r , return.\\r , \\r , \\'It is,\\' was the reply.  \\'Get up.\\'\\r , \\r , There was a candle burning, but the man hastily drew it from the\\r , candlestick, and hurled it under the grate.  Seeing the faint light of\\r , early day without, the girl rose to undraw the curtain.\\r , \\r , \\'Let it be,\\' said Sikes, thrusting his hand before her. \\'There\\'s enough\\r , light for wot I\\'ve got to do.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Bill,\\' said the girl, in the low voice of alarm, \\'why do you look like\\r , that at me!\\'\\r , \\r , The robber sat regarding her, for a few seconds, with dilated nostrils\\r , and heaving breast; and then, grasping her by the head and throat,\\r , dragged her into the middle of the room, and looking once towards the\\r , door, placed his heavy hand upon her mouth.\\r , \\r , \\'Bill, Bill!\\' gasped the girl, wrestling with the strength of mortal\\r , fear,--\\'I--I won\\'t scream or cry--not once--hear me--speak to me--tell\\r , me what I have done!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You know, you she devil!\\' returned the robber, suppressing his breath.\\r , \\'You were watched to-night; every word you said was heard.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then spare my life for the love of Heaven, as I spared yours,\\'\\r , rejoined the girl, clinging to him.  \\'Bill, dear Bill, you cannot have\\r , the heart to kill me.  Oh! think of all I have given up, only this one\\r , night, for you.  You _shall_ have time to think, and save yourself this\\r , crime; I will not loose my hold, you cannot throw me off.  Bill, Bill,\\r , for dear God\\'s sake, for your own, for mine, stop before you spill my\\r , blood!  I have been true to you, upon my guilty soul I have!\\'\\r , \\r , The man struggled violently, to release his arms; but those of the girl\\r , were clasped round his, and tear her as he would, he could not tear\\r , them away.\\r , \\r , \\'Bill,\\' cried the girl, striving to lay her head upon his breast, \\'the\\r , gentleman and that dear lady, told me to-night of a home in some\\r , foreign country where I could end my days in solitude and peace.  Let\\r , me see them again, and beg them, on my knees, to show the same mercy\\r , and goodness to you; and let us both leave this dreadful place, and far\\r , apart lead better lives, and forget how we have lived, except in\\r , prayers, and never see each other more. It is never too late to repent.\\r , They told me so--I feel it now--but we must have time--a little, little\\r , time!\\'\\r , \\r , The housebreaker freed one arm, and grasped his pistol. The certainty\\r , of immediate detection if he fired, flashed across his mind even in the\\r , midst of his fury; and he beat it twice with all the force he could\\r , summon, upon the upturned face that almost touched his own.\\r , \\r , She staggered and fell:  nearly blinded with the blood that rained down\\r , from a deep gash in her forehead; but raising herself, with difficulty,\\r , on her knees, drew from her bosom a white handkerchief--Rose Maylie\\'s\\r , own--and holding it up, in her folded hands, as high towards Heaven as\\r , her feeble strength would allow, breathed one prayer for mercy to her\\r , Maker.\\r , \\r , It was a ghastly figure to look upon.  The murderer staggering backward\\r , to the wall, and shutting out the sight with his hand, seized a heavy\\r , club and struck her down.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XLVIII\\r , \\r , THE FLIGHT OF SIKES\\r , \\r , Of all bad deeds that, under cover of the darkness, had been committed\\r , within wide London\\'s bounds since night hung over it, that was the\\r , worst.  Of all the horrors that rose with an ill scent upon the morning\\r , air, that was the foulest and most cruel.\\r , \\r , The sun--the bright sun, that brings back, not light alone, but new\\r , life, and hope, and freshness to man--burst upon the crowded city in\\r , clear and radiant glory.  Through costly-coloured glass and\\r , paper-mended window, through cathedral dome and rotten crevice, it shed\\r , its equal ray.  It lighted up the room where the murdered woman lay.\\r , It did.  He tried to shut it out, but it would stream in.  If the sight\\r , had been a ghastly one in the dull morning, what was it, now, in all\\r , that brilliant light!\\r , \\r , He had not moved; he had been afraid to stir.  There had been a moan\\r , and motion of the hand; and, with terror added to rage, he had struck\\r , and struck again.  Once he threw a rug over it; but it was worse to\\r , fancy the eyes, and imagine them moving towards him, than to see them\\r , glaring upward, as if watching the reflection of the pool of gore that\\r , quivered and danced in the sunlight on the ceiling.  He had plucked it\\r , off again.  And there was the body--mere flesh and blood, no more--but\\r , such flesh, and so much blood!\\r , \\r , He struck a light, kindled a fire, and thrust the club into it. There\\r , was hair upon the end, which blazed and shrunk into a light cinder,\\r , and, caught by the air, whirled up the chimney.  Even that frightened\\r , him, sturdy as he was; but he held the weapon till it broke, and then\\r , piled it on the coals to burn away, and smoulder into ashes.  He washed\\r , himself, and rubbed his clothes; there were spots that would not be\\r , removed, but he cut the pieces out, and burnt them.  How those stains\\r , were dispersed about the room!  The very feet of the dog were bloody.\\r , \\r , All this time he had, never once, turned his back upon the corpse; no,\\r , not for a moment.  Such preparations completed, he moved, backward,\\r , towards the door:  dragging the dog with him, lest he should soil his\\r , feet anew and carry out new evidence of the crime into the streets. He\\r , shut the door softly, locked it, took the key, and left the house.\\r , \\r , He crossed over, and glanced up at the window, to be sure that nothing\\r , was visible from the outside.  There was the curtain still drawn, which\\r , she would have opened to admit the light she never saw again.  It lay\\r , nearly under there.  _He_ knew that.  God, how the sun poured down upon\\r , the very spot!\\r , \\r , The glance was instantaneous.  It was a relief to have got free of the\\r , room.  He whistled on the dog, and walked rapidly away.\\r , \\r , He went through Islington; strode up the hill at Highgate on which\\r , stands the stone in honour of Whittington; turned down to Highgate\\r , Hill, unsteady of purpose, and uncertain where to go; struck off to the\\r , right again, almost as soon as he began to descend it; and taking the\\r , foot-path across the fields, skirted Caen Wood, and so came on\\r , Hampstead Heath.  Traversing the hollow by the Vale of Heath, he\\r , mounted the opposite bank, and crossing the road which joins the\\r , villages of Hampstead and Highgate, made along the remaining portion of\\r , the heath to the fields at North End, in one of which he laid himself\\r , down under a hedge, and slept.\\r , \\r , Soon he was up again, and away,--not far into the country, but back\\r , towards London by the high-road--then back again--then over another\\r , part of the same ground as he already traversed--then wandering up and\\r , down in fields, and lying on ditches\\' brinks to rest, and starting up\\r , to make for some other spot, and do the same, and ramble on again.\\r , \\r , Where could he go, that was near and not too public, to get some meat\\r , and drink?  Hendon.  That was a good place, not far off, and out of\\r , most people\\'s way.  Thither he directed his steps,--running sometimes,\\r , and sometimes, with a strange perversity, loitering at a snail\\'s pace,\\r , or stopping altogether and idly breaking the hedges with a stick.  But\\r , when he got there, all the people he met--the very children at the\\r , doors--seemed to view him with suspicion.  Back he turned again,\\r , without the courage to purchase bit or drop, though he had tasted no\\r , food for many hours; and once more he lingered on the Heath, uncertain\\r , where to go.\\r , \\r , He wandered over miles and miles of ground, and still came back to the\\r , old place.  Morning and noon had passed, and the day was on the wane,\\r , and still he rambled to and fro, and up and down, and round and round,\\r , and still lingered about the same spot.  At last he got away, and\\r , shaped his course for Hatfield.\\r , \\r , It was nine o\\'clock at night, when the man, quite tired out, and the\\r , dog, limping and lame from the unaccustomed exercise, turned down the\\r , hill by the church of the quiet village, and plodding along the little\\r , street, crept into a small public-house, whose scanty light had guided\\r , them to the spot.  There was a fire in the tap-room, and some\\r , country-labourers were drinking before it.\\r , \\r , They made room for the stranger, but he sat down in the furthest\\r , corner, and ate and drank alone, or rather with his dog:  to whom he\\r , cast a morsel of food from time to time.\\r , \\r , The conversation of the men assembled here, turned upon the\\r , neighbouring land, and farmers; and when those topics were exhausted,\\r , upon the age of some old man who had been buried on the previous\\r , Sunday; the young men present considering him very old, and the old men\\r , present declaring him to have been quite young--not older, one\\r , white-haired grandfather said, than he was--with ten or fifteen year of\\r , life in him at least--if he had taken care; if he had taken care.\\r , \\r , There was nothing to attract attention, or excite alarm in this. The\\r , robber, after paying his reckoning, sat silent and unnoticed in his\\r , corner, and had almost dropped asleep, when he was half wakened by the\\r , noisy entrance of a new comer.\\r , \\r , This was an antic fellow, half pedlar and half mountebank, who\\r , travelled about the country on foot to vend hones, strops, razors,\\r , washballs, harness-paste, medicine for dogs and horses, cheap\\r , perfumery, cosmetics, and such-like wares, which he carried in a case\\r , slung to his back.  His entrance was the signal for various homely\\r , jokes with the countrymen, which slackened not until he had made his\\r , supper, and opened his box of treasures, when he ingeniously contrived\\r , to unite business with amusement.\\r , \\r , \\'And what be that stoof?  Good to eat, Harry?\\' asked a grinning\\r , countryman, pointing to some composition-cakes in one corner.\\r , \\r , \\'This,\\' said the fellow, producing one, \\'this is the infallible and\\r , invaluable composition for removing all sorts of stain, rust, dirt,\\r , mildew, spick, speck, spot, or spatter, from silk, satin, linen,\\r , cambric, cloth, crape, stuff, carpet, merino, muslin, bombazeen, or\\r , woollen stuff.  Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains,\\r , paint-stains, pitch-stains, any stains, all come out at one rub with\\r , the infallible and invaluable composition.  If a lady stains her\\r , honour, she has only need to swallow one cake and she\\'s cured at\\r , once--for it\\'s poison.  If a gentleman wants to prove this, he has only\\r , need to bolt one little square, and he has put it beyond question--for\\r , it\\'s quite as satisfactory as a pistol-bullet, and a great deal nastier\\r , in the flavour, consequently the more credit in taking it.  One penny a\\r , square.  With all these virtues, one penny a square!\\'\\r , \\r , There were two buyers directly, and more of the listeners plainly\\r , hesitated.  The vendor observing this, increased in loquacity.\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s all bought up as fast as it can be made,\\' said the fellow. \\'There\\r , are fourteen water-mills, six steam-engines, and a galvanic battery,\\r , always a-working upon it, and they can\\'t make it fast enough, though\\r , the men work so hard that they die off, and the widows is pensioned\\r , directly, with twenty pound a-year for each of the children, and a\\r , premium of fifty for twins.  One penny a square!  Two half-pence is all\\r , the same, and four farthings is received with joy.  One penny a square!\\r , Wine-stains, fruit-stains, beer-stains, water-stains, paint-stains,\\r , pitch-stains, mud-stains, blood-stains!  Here is a stain upon the hat\\r , of a gentleman in company, that I\\'ll take clean out, before he can\\r , order me a pint of ale.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hah!\\' cried Sikes starting up.  \\'Give that back.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I\\'ll take it clean out, sir,\\' replied the man, winking to the company,\\r , \\'before you can come across the room to get it. Gentlemen all, observe\\r , the dark stain upon this gentleman\\'s hat, no wider than a shilling, but\\r , thicker than a half-crown.  Whether it is a wine-stain, fruit-stain,\\r , beer-stain, water-stain, paint-stain, pitch-stain, mud-stain, or\\r , blood-stain--\\'\\r , \\r , The man got no further, for Sikes with a hideous imprecation overthrew\\r , the table, and tearing the hat from him, burst out of the house.\\r , \\r , With the same perversity of feeling and irresolution that had fastened\\r , upon him, despite himself, all day, the murderer, finding that he was\\r , not followed, and that they most probably considered him some drunken\\r , sullen fellow, turned back up the town, and getting out of the glare of\\r , the lamps of a stage-coach that was standing in the street, was walking\\r , past, when he recognised the mail from London, and saw that it was\\r , standing at the little post-office.  He almost knew what was to come;\\r , but he crossed over, and listened.\\r , \\r , The guard was standing at the door, waiting for the letter-bag. A man,\\r , dressed like a game-keeper, came up at the moment, and he handed him a\\r , basket which lay ready on the pavement.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s for your people,\\' said the guard.  \\'Now, look alive in there,\\r , will you.  Damn that \\'ere bag, it warn\\'t ready night afore last; this\\r , won\\'t do, you know!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Anything new up in town, Ben?\\' asked the game-keeper, drawing back to\\r , the window-shutters, the better to admire the horses.\\r , \\r , \\'No, nothing that I knows on,\\' replied the man, pulling on his gloves.\\r , \\'Corn\\'s up a little.  I heerd talk of a murder, too, down Spitalfields\\r , way, but I don\\'t reckon much upon it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh, that\\'s quite true,\\' said a gentleman inside, who was looking out\\r , of the window.  \\'And a dreadful murder it was.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Was it, sir?\\' rejoined the guard, touching his hat.  \\'Man or woman,\\r , pray, sir?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'A woman,\\' replied the gentleman.  \\'It is supposed--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Now, Ben,\\' replied the coachman impatiently.\\r , \\r , \\'Damn that \\'ere bag,\\' said the guard; \\'are you gone to sleep in there?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Coming!\\' cried the office keeper, running out.\\r , \\r , \\'Coming,\\' growled the guard.  \\'Ah, and so\\'s the young \\'ooman of\\r , property that\\'s going to take a fancy to me, but I don\\'t know when.\\r , Here, give hold.  All ri--ight!\\'\\r , \\r , The horn sounded a few cheerful notes, and the coach was gone.\\r , \\r , Sikes remained standing in the street, apparently unmoved by what he\\r , had just heard, and agitated by no stronger feeling than a doubt where\\r , to go.  At length he went back again, and took the road which leads\\r , from Hatfield to St. Albans.\\r , \\r , He went on doggedly; but as he left the town behind him, and plunged\\r , into the solitude and darkness of the road, he felt a dread and awe\\r , creeping upon him which shook him to the core. Every object before him,\\r , substance or shadow, still or moving, took the semblance of some\\r , fearful thing; but these fears were nothing compared to the sense that\\r , haunted him of that morning\\'s ghastly figure following at his heels.\\r , He could trace its shadow in the gloom, supply the smallest item of the\\r , outline, and note how stiff and solemn it seemed to stalk along.  He\\r , could hear its garments rustling in the leaves, and every breath of\\r , wind came laden with that last low cry.  If he stopped it did the same.\\r , If he ran, it followed--not running too:  that would have been a\\r , relief:  but like a corpse endowed with the mere machinery of life, and\\r , borne on one slow melancholy wind that never rose or fell.\\r , \\r , At times, he turned, with desperate determination, resolved to beat\\r , this phantom off, though it should look him dead; but the hair rose on\\r , his head, and his blood stood still, for it had turned with him and was\\r , behind him then.  He had kept it before him that morning, but it was\\r , behind now--always.  He leaned his back against a bank, and felt that\\r , it stood above him, visibly out against the cold night-sky.  He threw\\r , himself upon the road--on his back upon the road.  At his head it\\r , stood, silent, erect, and still--a living grave-stone, with its epitaph\\r , in blood.\\r , \\r , Let no man talk of murderers escaping justice, and hint that Providence\\r , must sleep.  There were twenty score of violent deaths in one long\\r , minute of that agony of fear.\\r , \\r , There was a shed in a field he passed, that offered shelter for the\\r , night.  Before the door, were three tall poplar trees, which made it\\r , very dark within; and the wind moaned through them with a dismal wail.\\r , He _could not_ walk on, till daylight came again; and here he stretched\\r , himself close to the wall--to undergo new torture.\\r , \\r , For now, a vision came before him, as constant and more terrible than\\r , that from which he had escaped.  Those widely staring eyes, so\\r , lustreless and so glassy, that he had better borne to see them than\\r , think upon them, appeared in the midst of the darkness: light in\\r , themselves, but giving light to nothing.  There were but two, but they\\r , were everywhere.  If he shut out the sight, there came the room with\\r , every well-known object--some, indeed, that he would have forgotten, if\\r , he had gone over its contents from memory--each in its accustomed\\r , place.  The body was in _its_ place, and its eyes were as he saw them\\r , when he stole away.  He got up, and rushed into the field without.  The\\r , figure was behind him. He re-entered the shed, and shrunk down once\\r , more.  The eyes were there, before he had laid himself along.\\r , \\r , And here he remained in such terror as none but he can know, trembling\\r , in every limb, and the cold sweat starting from every pore, when\\r , suddenly there arose upon the night-wind the noise of distant shouting,\\r , and the roar of voices mingled in alarm and wonder.  Any sound of men\\r , in that lonely place, even though it conveyed a real cause of alarm,\\r , was something to him.  He regained his strength and energy at the\\r , prospect of personal danger; and springing to his feet, rushed into the\\r , open air.\\r , \\r , The broad sky seemed on fire.  Rising into the air with showers of\\r , sparks, and rolling one above the other, were sheets of flame, lighting\\r , the atmosphere for miles round, and driving clouds of smoke in the\\r , direction where he stood.  The shouts grew louder as new voices swelled\\r , the roar, and he could hear the cry of Fire! mingled with the ringing\\r , of an alarm-bell, the fall of heavy bodies, and the crackling of flames\\r , as they twined round some new obstacle, and shot aloft as though\\r , refreshed by food.  The noise increased as he looked.  There were\\r , people there--men and women--light, bustle.  It was like new life to\\r , him.  He darted onward--straight, headlong--dashing through brier and\\r , brake, and leaping gate and fence as madly as his dog, who careered\\r , with loud and sounding bark before him.\\r , \\r , He came upon the spot.  There were half-dressed figures tearing to and\\r , fro, some endeavouring to drag the frightened horses from the stables,\\r , others driving the cattle from the yard and out-houses, and others\\r , coming laden from the burning pile, amidst a shower of falling sparks,\\r , and the tumbling down of red-hot beams.  The apertures, where doors and\\r , windows stood an hour ago, disclosed a mass of raging fire; walls\\r , rocked and crumbled into the burning well; the molten lead and iron\\r , poured down, white hot, upon the ground.  Women and children shrieked,\\r , and men encouraged each other with noisy shouts and cheers.  The\\r , clanking of the engine-pumps, and the spirting and hissing of the water\\r , as it fell upon the blazing wood, added to the tremendous roar.  He\\r , shouted, too, till he was hoarse; and flying from memory and himself,\\r , plunged into the thickest of the throng.  Hither and thither he dived\\r , that night:  now working at the pumps, and now hurrying through the\\r , smoke and flame, but never ceasing to engage himself wherever noise and\\r , men were thickest.  Up and down the ladders, upon the roofs of\\r , buildings, over floors that quaked and trembled with his weight, under\\r , the lee of falling bricks and stones, in every part of that great fire\\r , was he; but he bore a charmed life, and had neither scratch nor bruise,\\r , nor weariness nor thought, till morning dawned again, and only smoke\\r , and blackened ruins remained.\\r , \\r , This mad excitement over, there returned, with ten-fold force, the\\r , dreadful consciousness of his crime.  He looked suspiciously about him,\\r , for the men were conversing in groups, and he feared to be the subject\\r , of their talk.  The dog obeyed the significant beck of his finger, and\\r , they drew off, stealthily, together.  He passed near an engine where\\r , some men were seated, and they called to him to share in their\\r , refreshment.  He took some bread and meat; and as he drank a draught of\\r , beer, heard the firemen, who were from London, talking about the\\r , murder.  \\'He has gone to Birmingham, they say,\\' said one:  \\'but they\\'ll\\r , have him yet, for the scouts are out, and by to-morrow night there\\'ll\\r , be a cry all through the country.\\'\\r , \\r , He hurried off, and walked till he almost dropped upon the ground; then\\r , lay down in a lane, and had a long, but broken and uneasy sleep.  He\\r , wandered on again, irresolute and undecided, and oppressed with the\\r , fear of another solitary night.\\r , \\r , Suddenly, he took the desperate resolution to going back to London.\\r , \\r , \\'There\\'s somebody to speak to there, at all event,\\' he thought. \\'A good\\r , hiding-place, too.  They\\'ll never expect to nab me there, after this\\r , country scent.  Why can\\'t I lie by for a week or so, and, forcing blunt\\r , from Fagin, get abroad to France?  Damme, I\\'ll risk it.\\'\\r , \\r , He acted upon this impulse without delay, and choosing the least\\r , frequented roads began his journey back, resolved to lie concealed\\r , within a short distance of the metropolis, and, entering it at dusk by\\r , a circuitous route, to proceed straight to that part of it which he had\\r , fixed on for his destination.\\r , \\r , The dog, though.  If any description of him were out, it would not be\\r , forgotten that the dog was missing, and had probably gone with him.\\r , This might lead to his apprehension as he passed along the streets.  He\\r , resolved to drown him, and walked on, looking about for a pond:\\r , picking up a heavy stone and tying it to his handkerchief as he went.\\r , \\r , The animal looked up into his master\\'s face while these preparations\\r , were making; whether his instinct apprehended something of their\\r , purpose, or the robber\\'s sidelong look at him was sterner than\\r , ordinary, he skulked a little farther in the rear than usual, and\\r , cowered as he came more slowly along.  When his master halted at the\\r , brink of a pool, and looked round to call him, he stopped outright.\\r , \\r , \\'Do you hear me call?  Come here!\\' cried Sikes.\\r , \\r , The animal came up from the very force of habit; but as Sikes stooped\\r , to attach the handkerchief to his throat, he uttered a low growl and\\r , started back.\\r , \\r , \\'Come back!\\' said the robber.\\r , \\r , The dog wagged his tail, but moved not.  Sikes made a running noose and\\r , called him again.\\r , \\r , The dog advanced, retreated, paused an instant, and scoured away at his\\r , hardest speed.\\r , \\r , The man whistled again and again, and sat down and waited in the\\r , expectation that he would return.  But no dog appeared, and at length\\r , he resumed his journey.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER XLIX\\r , \\r , MONKS AND MR. BROWNLOW AT LENGTH MEET.  THEIR CONVERSATION, AND THE\\r , INTELLIGENCE THAT INTERRUPTS IT\\r , \\r ,  The twilight was beginning to close in, when Mr. Brownlow\\r , alighted from a hackney-coach at his own door, and knocked softly.  The\\r , door being opened, a sturdy man got out of the coach and stationed\\r , himself on one side of the steps, while another man, who had been\\r , seated on the box, dismounted too, and stood upon the other side.  At a\\r , sign from Mr. Brownlow, they helped out a third man, and taking him\\r , between them, hurried him into the house. This man was Monks.\\r , \\r , They walked in the same manner up the stairs without speaking, and Mr.\\r , Brownlow, preceding them, led the way into a back-room. At the door of\\r , this apartment, Monks, who had ascended with evident reluctance,\\r , stopped.  The two men looked at the old gentleman as if for\\r , instructions.\\r , \\r , \\'He knows the alternative,\\' said Mr. Browlow.  \\'If he hesitates or\\r , moves a finger but as you bid him, drag him into the street, call for\\r , the aid of the police, and impeach him as a felon in my name.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'How dare you say this of me?\\' asked Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'How dare you urge me to it, young man?\\' replied Mr. Brownlow,\\r , confronting him with a steady look.  \\'Are you mad enough to leave this\\r , house?  Unhand him.  There, sir. You are free to go, and we to follow.\\r , But I warn you, by all I hold most solemn and most sacred, that instant\\r , will have you apprehended on a charge of fraud and robbery.  I am\\r , resolute and immoveable.  If you are determined to be the same, your\\r , blood be upon your own head!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'By what authority am I kidnapped in the street, and brought here by\\r , these dogs?\\' asked Monks, looking from one to the other of the men who\\r , stood beside him.\\r , \\r , \\'By mine,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow.  \\'Those persons are indemnified by me.\\r , If you complain of being deprived of your liberty--you had power and\\r , opportunity to retrieve it as you came along, but you deemed it\\r , advisable to remain quiet--I say again, throw yourself for protection\\r , on the law.  I will appeal to the law too; but when you have gone too\\r , far to recede, do not sue to me for leniency, when the power will have\\r , passed into other hands; and do not say I plunged you down the gulf\\r , into which you rushed, yourself.\\'\\r , \\r , Monks was plainly disconcerted, and alarmed besides.  He hesitated.\\r , \\r , \\'You will decide quickly,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, with perfect firmness and\\r , composure.  \\'If you wish me to prefer my charges publicly, and consign\\r , you to a punishment the extent of which, although I can, with a\\r , shudder, foresee, I cannot control, once more, I say, for you know the\\r , way.  If not, and you appeal to my forbearance, and the mercy of those\\r , you have deeply injured, seat yourself, without a word, in that chair.\\r , It has waited for you two whole days.\\'\\r , \\r , Monks muttered some unintelligible words, but wavered still.\\r , \\r , \\'You will be prompt,\\' said Mr. Brownlow.  \\'A word from me, and the\\r , alternative has gone for ever.\\'\\r , \\r , Still the man hesitated.\\r , \\r , \\'I have not the inclination to parley,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, \\'and, as I\\r , advocate the dearest interests of others, I have not the right.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Is there--\\' demanded Monks with a faltering tongue,--\\'is there--no\\r , middle course?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'None.\\'\\r , \\r , Monks looked at the old gentleman, with an anxious eye; but, reading in\\r , his countenance nothing but severity and determination, walked into the\\r , room, and, shrugging his shoulders, sat down.\\r , \\r , \\'Lock the door on the outside,\\' said Mr. Brownlow to the attendants,\\r , \\'and come when I ring.\\'\\r , \\r , The men obeyed, and the two were left alone together.\\r , \\r , \\'This is pretty treatment, sir,\\' said Monks, throwing down his hat and\\r , cloak, \\'from my father\\'s oldest friend.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It is because I was your father\\'s oldest friend, young man,\\' returned\\r , Mr. Brownlow; \\'it is because the hopes and wishes of young and happy\\r , years were bound up with him, and that fair creature of his blood and\\r , kindred who rejoined her God in youth, and left me here a solitary,\\r , lonely man:  it is because he knelt with me beside his only sisters\\'s\\r , death-bed when he was yet a boy, on the morning that would--but Heaven\\r , willed otherwise--have made her my young wife; it is because my seared\\r , heart clung to him, from that time forth, through all his trials and\\r , errors, till he died; it is because old recollections and associations\\r , filled my heart, and even the sight of you brings with it old thoughts\\r , of him; it is because of all these things that I am moved to treat you\\r , gently now--yes, Edward Leeford, even now--and blush for your\\r , unworthiness who bear the name.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What has the name to do with it?\\' asked the other, after\\r , contemplating, half in silence, and half in dogged wonder, the\\r , agitation of his companion.  \\'What is the name to me?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow, \\'nothing to you.  But it was _hers_,\\r , and even at this distance of time brings back to me, an old man, the\\r , glow and thrill which I once felt, only to hear it repeated by a\\r , stranger.  I am very glad you have changed it--very--very.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'This is all mighty fine,\\' said Monks (to retain his assumed\\r , designation) after a long silence, during which he had jerked himself\\r , in sullen defiance to and fro, and Mr. Brownlow had sat, shading his\\r , face with his hand. \\'But what do you want with me?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You have a brother,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, rousing himself:  \\'a brother,\\r , the whisper of whose name in your ear when I came behind you in the\\r , street, was, in itself, almost enough to make you accompany me hither,\\r , in wonder and alarm.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I have no brother,\\' replied Monks.  \\'You know I was an only child.\\r , Why do you talk to me of brothers?  You know that, as well as I.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Attend to what I do know, and you may not,\\' said Mr. Brownlow. \\'I\\r , shall interest you by and by.  I know that of the wretched marriage,\\r , into which family pride, and the most sordid and narrowest of all\\r , ambition, forced your unhappy father when a mere boy, you were the sole\\r , and most unnatural issue.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I don\\'t care for hard names,\\' interrupted Monks with a jeering laugh.\\r , \\'You know the fact, and that\\'s enough for me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'But I also know,\\' pursued the old gentleman, \\'the misery, the slow\\r , torture, the protracted anguish of that ill-assorted union. I know how\\r , listlessly and wearily each of that wretched pair dragged on their\\r , heavy chain through a world that was poisoned to them both.  I know how\\r , cold formalities were succeeded by open taunts; how indifference gave\\r , place to dislike, dislike to hate, and hate to loathing, until at last\\r , they wrenched the clanking bond asunder, and retiring a wide space\\r , apart, carried each a galling fragment, of which nothing but death\\r , could break the rivets, to hide it in new society beneath the gayest\\r , looks they could assume.  Your mother succeeded; she forgot it soon.\\r , But it rusted and cankered at your father\\'s heart for years.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Well, they were separated,\\' said Monks, \\'and what of that?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'When they had been separated for some time,\\' returned Mr. Brownlow,\\r , \\'and your mother, wholly given up to continental frivolities, had\\r , utterly forgotten the young husband ten good years her junior, who,\\r , with prospects blighted, lingered on at home, he fell among new\\r , friends.  This circumstance, at least, you know already.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not I,\\' said Monks, turning away his eyes and beating his foot upon\\r , the ground, as a man who is determined to deny everything. \\'Not I.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Your manner, no less than your actions, assures me that you have never\\r , forgotten it, or ceased to think of it with bitterness,\\' returned Mr.\\r , Brownlow.  \\'I speak of fifteen years ago, when you were not more than\\r , eleven years old, and your father but one-and-thirty--for he was, I\\r , repeat, a boy, when _his_ father ordered him to marry. Must I go back\\r , to events which cast a shade upon the memory of your parent, or will\\r , you spare it, and disclose to me the truth?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I have nothing to disclose,\\' rejoined Monks.  \\'You must talk on if you\\r , will.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'These new friends, then,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, \\'were a naval officer\\r , retired from active service, whose wife had died some half-a-year\\r , before, and left him with two children--there had been more, but, of\\r , all their family, happily but two survived. They were both daughters;\\r , one a beautiful creature of nineteen, and the other a mere child of two\\r , or three years old.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s this to me?\\' asked Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'They resided,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, without seeming to hear the\\r , interruption, \\'in a part of the country to which your father in his\\r , wandering had repaired, and where he had taken up his abode.\\r , Acquaintance, intimacy, friendship, fast followed on each other. Your\\r , father was gifted as few men are.  He had his sister\\'s soul and person.\\r , As the old officer knew him more and more, he grew to love him.  I\\r , would that it had ended there.  His daughter did the same.\\'\\r , \\r , The old gentleman paused; Monks was biting his lips, with his eyes\\r , fixed upon the floor; seeing this, he immediately resumed:\\r , \\r , \\'The end of a year found him contracted, solemnly contracted, to that\\r , daughter; the object of the first, true, ardent, only passion of a\\r , guileless girl.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Your tale is of the longest,\\' observed Monks, moving restlessly in his\\r , chair.\\r , \\r , \\'It is a true tale of grief and trial, and sorrow, young man,\\' returned\\r , Mr. Brownlow, \\'and such tales usually are; if it were one of unmixed\\r , joy and happiness, it would be very brief.  At length one of those rich\\r , relations to strengthen whose interest and importance your father had\\r , been sacrificed, as others are often--it is no uncommon case--died, and\\r , to repair the misery he had been instrumental in occasioning, left him\\r , his panacea for all griefs--Money.  It was necessary that he should\\r , immediately repair to Rome, whither this man had sped for health, and\\r , where he had died, leaving his affairs in great confusion.  He went;\\r , was seized with mortal illness there; was followed, the moment the\\r , intelligence reached Paris, by your mother who carried you with her; he\\r , died the day after her arrival, leaving no will--_no will_--so that the\\r , whole property fell to her and you.\\'\\r , \\r , At this part of the recital Monks held his breath, and listened with a\\r , face of intense eagerness, though his eyes were not directed towards\\r , the speaker.  As Mr. Brownlow paused, he changed his position with the\\r , air of one who has experienced a sudden relief, and wiped his hot face\\r , and hands.\\r , \\r , \\'Before he went abroad, and as he passed through London on his way,\\'\\r , said Mr. Brownlow, slowly, and fixing his eyes upon the other\\'s face,\\r , \\'he came to me.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I never heard of that,\\' interrupted Monks in a tone intended to appear\\r , incredulous, but savouring more of disagreeable surprise.\\r , \\r , \\'He came to me, and left with me, among some other things, a picture--a\\r , portrait painted by himself--a likeness of this poor girl--which he did\\r , not wish to leave behind, and could not carry forward on his hasty\\r , journey.  He was worn by anxiety and remorse almost to a shadow; talked\\r , in a wild, distracted way, of ruin and dishonour worked by himself;\\r , confided to me his intention to convert his whole property, at any\\r , loss, into money, and, having settled on his wife and you a portion of\\r , his recent acquisition, to fly the country--I guessed too well he would\\r , not fly alone--and never see it more.  Even from me, his old and early\\r , friend, whose strong attachment had taken root in the earth that\\r , covered one most dear to both--even from me he withheld any more\\r , particular confession, promising to write and tell me all, and after\\r , that to see me once again, for the last time on earth. Alas!  _That_\\r , was the last time.  I had no letter, and I never saw him more.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I went,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, after a short pause, \\'I went, when all was\\r , over, to the scene of his--I will use the term the world would freely\\r , use, for worldly harshness or favour are now alike to him--of his\\r , guilty love, resolved that if my fears were realised that erring child\\r , should find one heart and home to shelter and compassionate her.  The\\r , family had left that part a week before; they had called in such\\r , trifling debts as were outstanding, discharged them, and left the place\\r , by night.  Why, or whither, none can tell.\\'\\r , \\r , Monks drew his breath yet more freely, and looked round with a smile of\\r , triumph.\\r , \\r , \\'When your brother,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, drawing nearer to the other\\'s\\r , chair, \\'When your brother:  a feeble, ragged, neglected child:  was\\r , cast in my way by a stronger hand than chance, and rescued by me from a\\r , life of vice and infamy--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What?\\' cried Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'By me,\\' said Mr. Brownlow.  \\'I told you I should interest you before\\r , long.  I say by me--I see that your cunning associate suppressed my\\r , name, although for ought he knew, it would be quite strange to your\\r , ears.  When he was rescued by me, then, and lay recovering from\\r , sickness in my house, his strong resemblance to this picture I have\\r , spoken of, struck me with astonishment.  Even when I first saw him in\\r , all his dirt and misery, there was a lingering expression in his face\\r , that came upon me like a glimpse of some old friend flashing on one in\\r , a vivid dream.  I need not tell you he was snared away before I knew\\r , his history--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why not?\\' asked Monks hastily.\\r , \\r , \\'Because you know it well.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Denial to me is vain,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow.  \\'I shall show you that I\\r , know more than that.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You--you--can\\'t prove anything against me,\\' stammered Monks.  \\'I defy\\r , you to do it!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'We shall see,\\' returned the old gentleman with a searching glance.  \\'I\\r , lost the boy, and no efforts of mine could recover him.  Your mother\\r , being dead, I knew that you alone could solve the mystery if anybody\\r , could, and as when I had last heard of you you were on your own estate\\r , in the West Indies--whither, as you well know, you retired upon your\\r , mother\\'s death to escape the consequences of vicious courses here--I\\r , made the voyage.  You had left it, months before, and were supposed to\\r , be in London, but no one could tell where.  I returned.  Your agents\\r , had no clue to your residence.  You came and went, they said, as\\r , strangely as you had ever done:  sometimes for days together and\\r , sometimes not for months:  keeping to all appearance the same low\\r , haunts and mingling with the same infamous herd who had been your\\r , associates when a fierce ungovernable boy.  I wearied them with new\\r , applications.  I paced the streets by night and day, but until two\\r , hours ago, all my efforts were fruitless, and I never saw you for an\\r , instant.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And now you do see me,\\' said Monks, rising boldly, \\'what then? Fraud\\r , and robbery are high-sounding words--justified, you think, by a fancied\\r , resemblance in some young imp to an idle daub of a dead man\\'s Brother!\\r , You don\\'t even know that a child was born of this maudlin pair; you\\r , don\\'t even know that.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I _did not_,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow, rising too; \\'but within the last\\r , fortnight I have learnt it all.  You have a brother; you know it, and\\r , him.  There was a will, which your mother destroyed, leaving the secret\\r , and the gain to you at her own death.  It contained a reference to some\\r , child likely to be the result of this sad connection, which child was\\r , born, and accidentally encountered by you, when your suspicions were\\r , first awakened by his resemblance to your father.  You repaired to the\\r , place of his birth. There existed proofs--proofs long suppressed--of\\r , his birth and parentage.  Those proofs were destroyed by you, and now,\\r , in your own words to your accomplice the Jew, \"_the only proofs of the\\r , boy\\'s identity lie at the bottom of the river, and the old hag that\\r , received them from the mother is rotting in her coffin_.\" Unworthy son,\\r , coward, liar,--you, who hold your councils with thieves and murderers\\r , in dark rooms at night,--you, whose plots and wiles have brought a\\r , violent death upon the head of one worth millions such as you,--you,\\r , who from your cradle were gall and bitterness to your own father\\'s\\r , heart, and in whom all evil passions, vice, and profligacy, festered,\\r , till they found a vent in a hideous disease which had made your face an\\r , index even to your mind--you, Edward Leeford, do you still brave me!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, no, no!\\' returned the coward, overwhelmed by these accumulated\\r , charges.\\r , \\r , \\'Every word!\\' cried the gentleman, \\'every word that has passed between\\r , you and this detested villain, is known to me.  Shadows on the wall\\r , have caught your whispers, and brought them to my ear; the sight of the\\r , persecuted child has turned vice itself, and given it the courage and\\r , almost the attributes of virtue. Murder has been done, to which you\\r , were morally if not really a party.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, no,\\' interposed Monks.  \\'I--I knew nothing of that; I was going to\\r , inquire the truth of the story when you overtook me.  I didn\\'t know the\\r , cause.  I thought it was a common quarrel.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It was the partial disclosure of your secrets,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow.\\r , \\'Will you disclose the whole?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, I will.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Set your hand to a statement of truth and facts, and repeat it before\\r , witnesses?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'That I promise too.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Remain quietly here, until such a document is drawn up, and proceed\\r , with me to such a place as I may deem most advisable, for the purpose\\r , of attesting it?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If you insist upon that, I\\'ll do that also,\\' replied Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'You must do more than that,\\' said Mr. Brownlow.  \\'Make restitution to\\r , an innocent and unoffending child, for such he is, although the\\r , offspring of a guilty and most miserable love.  You have not forgotten\\r , the provisions of the will.  Carry them into execution so far as your\\r , brother is concerned, and then go where you please.  In this world you\\r , need meet no more.\\'\\r , \\r , While Monks was pacing up and down, meditating with dark and evil looks\\r , on this proposal and the possibilities of evading it:  torn by his\\r , fears on the one hand and his hatred on the other:  the door was\\r , hurriedly unlocked, and a gentleman (Mr. Losberne) entered the room in\\r , violent agitation.\\r , \\r , \\'The man will be taken,\\' he cried.  \\'He will be taken to-night!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The murderer?\\' asked Mr. Brownlow.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, yes,\\' replied the other.  \\'His dog has been seen lurking about\\r , some old haunt, and there seems little doubt that his master either is,\\r , or will be, there, under cover of the darkness.  Spies are hovering\\r , about in every direction.  I have spoken to the men who are charged\\r , with his capture, and they tell me he cannot escape.  A reward of a\\r , hundred pounds is proclaimed by Government to-night.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I will give fifty more,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, \\'and proclaim it with my\\r , own lips upon the spot, if I can reach it.  Where is Mr. Maylie?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Harry?  As soon as he had seen your friend here, safe in a coach with\\r , you, he hurried off to where he heard this,\\' replied the doctor, \\'and\\r , mounting his horse sallied forth to join the first party at some place\\r , in the outskirts agreed upon between them.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Fagin,\\' said Mr. Brownlow; \\'what of him?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'When I last heard, he had not been taken, but he will be, or is, by\\r , this time.  They\\'re sure of him.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Have you made up your mind?\\' asked Mr. Brownlow, in a low voice, of\\r , Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' he replied.  \\'You--you--will be secret with me?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I will.  Remain here till I return.  It is your only hope of safety.\\'\\r , \\r , They left the room, and the door was again locked.\\r , \\r , \\'What have you done?\\' asked the doctor in a whisper.\\r , \\r , \\'All that I could hope to do, and even more.  Coupling the poor girl\\'s\\r , intelligence with my previous knowledge, and the result of our good\\r , friend\\'s inquiries on the spot, I left him no loophole of escape, and\\r , laid bare the whole villainy which by these lights became plain as day.\\r , Write and appoint the evening after to-morrow, at seven, for the\\r , meeting.  We shall be down there, a few hours before, but shall require\\r , rest:  especially the young lady, who _may_ have greater need of\\r , firmness than either you or I can quite foresee just now.  But my blood\\r , boils to avenge this poor murdered creature.  Which way have they\\r , taken?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Drive straight to the office and you will be in time,\\' replied Mr.\\r , Losberne.  \\'I will remain here.\\'\\r , \\r , The two gentlemen hastily separated; each in a fever of excitement\\r , wholly uncontrollable.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER L\\r , \\r , THE PURSUIT AND ESCAPE\\r , \\r , Near to that part of the Thames on which the church at Rotherhithe\\r , abuts, where the buildings on the banks are dirtiest and the vessels on\\r , the river blackest with the dust of colliers and the smoke of\\r , close-built low-roofed houses, there exists the filthiest, the\\r , strangest, the most extraordinary of the many localities that are\\r , hidden in London, wholly unknown, even by name, to the great mass of\\r , its inhabitants.\\r , \\r , To reach this place, the visitor has to penetrate through a maze of\\r , close, narrow, and muddy streets, thronged by the roughest and poorest\\r , of waterside people, and devoted to the traffic they may be supposed to\\r , occasion.  The cheapest and least delicate provisions are heaped in the\\r , shops; the coarsest and commonest articles of wearing apparel dangle at\\r , the salesman\\'s door, and stream from the house-parapet and windows.\\r , Jostling with unemployed labourers of the lowest class,\\r , ballast-heavers, coal-whippers, brazen women, ragged children, and the\\r , raff and refuse of the river, he makes his way with difficulty along,\\r , assailed by offensive sights and smells from the narrow alleys which\\r , branch off on the right and left, and deafened by the clash of\\r , ponderous waggons that bear great piles of merchandise from the stacks\\r , of warehouses that rise from every corner.  Arriving, at length, in\\r , streets remoter and less-frequented than those through which he has\\r , passed, he walks beneath tottering house-fronts projecting over the\\r , pavement, dismantled walls that seem to totter as he passes, chimneys\\r , half crushed half hesitating to fall, windows guarded by rusty iron\\r , bars that time and dirt have almost eaten away, every imaginable sign\\r , of desolation and neglect.\\r , \\r , In such a neighborhood, beyond Dockhead in the Borough of Southwark,\\r , stands Jacob\\'s Island, surrounded by a muddy ditch, six or eight feet\\r , deep and fifteen or twenty wide when the tide is in, once called Mill\\r , Pond, but known in the days of this story as Folly Ditch.  It is a\\r , creek or inlet from the Thames, and can always be filled at high water\\r , by opening the sluices at the Lead Mills from which it took its old\\r , name.  At such times, a stranger, looking from one of the wooden\\r , bridges thrown across it at Mill Lane, will see the inhabitants of the\\r , houses on either side lowering from their back doors and windows,\\r , buckets, pails, domestic utensils of all kinds, in which to haul the\\r , water up; and when his eye is turned from these operations to the\\r , houses themselves, his utmost astonishment will be excited by the scene\\r , before him.  Crazy wooden galleries common to the backs of half a dozen\\r , houses, with holes from which to look upon the slime beneath; windows,\\r , broken and patched, with poles thrust out, on which to dry the linen\\r , that is never there; rooms so small, so filthy, so confined, that the\\r , air would seem too tainted even for the dirt and squalor which they\\r , shelter; wooden chambers thrusting themselves out above the mud, and\\r , threatening to fall into it--as some have done; dirt-besmeared walls\\r , and decaying foundations; every repulsive lineament of poverty, every\\r , loathsome indication of filth, rot, and garbage; all these ornament the\\r , banks of Folly Ditch.\\r , \\r , In Jacob\\'s Island, the warehouses are roofless and empty; the walls are\\r , crumbling down; the windows are windows no more; the doors are falling\\r , into the streets; the chimneys are blackened, but they yield no smoke.\\r , Thirty or forty years ago, before losses and chancery suits came upon\\r , it, it was a thriving place; but now it is a desolate island indeed.\\r , The houses have no owners; they are broken open, and entered upon by\\r , those who have the courage; and there they live, and there they die.\\r , They must have powerful motives for a secret residence, or be reduced\\r , to a destitute condition indeed, who seek a refuge in Jacob\\'s Island.\\r , \\r , In an upper room of one of these houses--a detached house of fair size,\\r , ruinous in other respects, but strongly defended at door and window:\\r , of which house the back commanded the ditch in manner already\\r , described--there were assembled three men, who, regarding each other\\r , every now and then with looks expressive of perplexity and expectation,\\r , sat for some time in profound and gloomy silence.  One of these was\\r , Toby Crackit, another Mr. Chitling, and the third a robber of fifty\\r , years, whose nose had been almost beaten in, in some old scuffle, and\\r , whose face bore a frightful scar which might probably be traced to the\\r , same occasion.  This man was a returned transport, and his name was\\r , Kags.\\r , \\r , \\'I wish,\\' said Toby turning to Mr. Chitling, \\'that you had picked out\\r , some other crib when the two old ones got too warm, and had not come\\r , here, my fine feller.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Why didn\\'t you, blunder-head!\\' said Kags.\\r , \\r , \\'Well, I thought you\\'d have been a little more glad to see me than\\r , this,\\' replied Mr. Chitling, with a melancholy air.\\r , \\r , \\'Why, look\\'e, young gentleman,\\' said Toby, \\'when a man keeps himself so\\r , very ex-clusive as I have done, and by that means has a snug house over\\r , his head with nobody a prying and smelling about it, it\\'s rather a\\r , startling thing to have the honour of a wisit from a young gentleman\\r , (however respectable and pleasant a person he may be to play cards with\\r , at conweniency) circumstanced as you are.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Especially, when the exclusive young man has got a friend stopping\\r , with him, that\\'s arrived sooner than was expected from foreign parts,\\r , and is too modest to want to be presented to the Judges on his return,\\'\\r , added Mr. Kags.\\r , \\r , There was a short silence, after which Toby Crackit, seeming to abandon\\r , as hopeless any further effort to maintain his usual devil-may-care\\r , swagger, turned to Chitling and said,\\r , \\r , \\'When was Fagin took then?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Just at dinner-time--two o\\'clock this afternoon.  Charley and I made\\r , our lucky up the wash-us chimney, and Bolter got into the empty\\r , water-butt, head downwards; but his legs were so precious long that\\r , they stuck out at the top, and so they took him too.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And Bet?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Poor Bet!  She went to see the Body, to speak to who it was,\\' replied\\r , Chitling, his countenance falling more and more, \\'and went off mad,\\r , screaming and raving, and beating her head against the boards; so they\\r , put a strait-weskut on her and took her to the hospital--and there she\\r , is.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Wot\\'s come of young Bates?\\' demanded Kags.\\r , \\r , \\'He hung about, not to come over here afore dark, but he\\'ll be here\\r , soon,\\' replied Chitling.  \\'There\\'s nowhere else to go to now, for the\\r , people at the Cripples are all in custody, and the bar of the ken--I\\r , went up there and see it with my own eyes--is filled with traps.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'This is a smash,\\' observed Toby, biting his lips. \\'There\\'s more than\\r , one will go with this.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The sessions are on,\\' said Kags:  \\'if they get the inquest over, and\\r , Bolter turns King\\'s evidence:  as of course he will, from what he\\'s\\r , said already:  they can prove Fagin an accessory before the fact, and\\r , get the trial on on Friday, and he\\'ll swing in six days from this, by\\r , G--!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You should have heard the people groan,\\' said Chitling; \\'the officers\\r , fought like devils, or they\\'d have torn him away.  He was down once,\\r , but they made a ring round him, and fought their way along.  You should\\r , have seen how he looked about him, all muddy and bleeding, and clung to\\r , them as if they were his dearest friends.  I can see \\'em now, not able\\r , to stand upright with the pressing of the mob, and draggin him along\\r , amongst \\'em; I can see the people jumping up, one behind another, and\\r , snarling with their teeth and making at him; I can see the blood upon\\r , his hair and beard, and hear the cries with which the women worked\\r , themselves into the centre of the crowd at the street corner, and swore\\r , they\\'d tear his heart out!\\'\\r , \\r , The horror-stricken witness of this scene pressed his hands upon his\\r , ears, and with his eyes closed got up and paced violently to and fro,\\r , like one distracted.\\r , \\r , While he was thus engaged, and the two men sat by in silence with their\\r , eyes fixed upon the floor, a pattering noise was heard upon the stairs,\\r , and Sikes\\'s dog bounded into the room.  They ran to the window,\\r , downstairs, and into the street.  The dog had jumped in at an open\\r , window; he made no attempt to follow them, nor was his master to be\\r , seen.\\r , \\r , \\'What\\'s the meaning of this?\\' said Toby when they had returned. \\'He\\r , can\\'t be coming here.  I--I--hope not.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If he was coming here, he\\'d have come with the dog,\\' said Kags,\\r , stooping down to examine the animal, who lay panting on the floor.\\r , \\'Here!  Give us some water for him; he has run himself faint.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He\\'s drunk it all up, every drop,\\' said Chitling after watching the\\r , dog some time in silence.  \\'Covered with mud--lame--half blind--he must\\r , have come a long way.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Where can he have come from!\\' exclaimed Toby.  \\'He\\'s been to the other\\r , kens of course, and finding them filled with strangers come on here,\\r , where he\\'s been many a time and often.  But where can he have come from\\r , first, and how comes he here alone without the other!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'He\\'--(none of them called the murderer by his old name)--\\'He can\\'t\\r , have made away with himself.  What do you think?\\' said Chitling.\\r , \\r , Toby shook his head.\\r , \\r , \\'If he had,\\' said Kags, \\'the dog \\'ud want to lead us away to where he\\r , did it.  No.  I think he\\'s got out of the country, and left the dog\\r , behind.  He must have given him the slip somehow, or he wouldn\\'t be so\\r , easy.\\'\\r , \\r , This solution, appearing the most probable one, was adopted as the\\r , right; the dog, creeping under a chair, coiled himself up to sleep,\\r , without more notice from anybody.\\r , \\r , It being now dark, the shutter was closed, and a candle lighted and\\r , placed upon the table.  The terrible events of the last two days had\\r , made a deep impression on all three, increased by the danger and\\r , uncertainty of their own position.  They drew their chairs closer\\r , together, starting at every sound.  They spoke little, and that in\\r , whispers, and were as silent and awe-stricken as if the remains of the\\r , murdered woman lay in the next room.\\r , \\r , They had sat thus, some time, when suddenly was heard a hurried\\r , knocking at the door below.\\r , \\r , \\'Young Bates,\\' said Kags, looking angrily round, to check the fear he\\r , felt himself.\\r , \\r , The knocking came again.  No, it wasn\\'t he.  He never knocked like that.\\r , \\r , Crackit went to the window, and shaking all over, drew in his head.\\r , There was no need to tell them who it was; his pale face was enough.\\r , The dog too was on the alert in an instant, and ran whining to the door.\\r , \\r , \\'We must let him in,\\' he said, taking up the candle.\\r , \\r , \\'Isn\\'t there any help for it?\\' asked the other man in a hoarse voice.\\r , \\r , \\'None.  He _must_ come in.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t leave us in the dark,\\' said Kags, taking down a candle from the\\r , chimney-piece, and lighting it, with such a trembling hand that the\\r , knocking was twice repeated before he had finished.\\r , \\r , Crackit went down to the door, and returned followed by a man with the\\r , lower part of his face buried in a handkerchief, and another tied over\\r , his head under his hat.  He drew them slowly off.  Blanched face,\\r , sunken eyes, hollow cheeks, beard of three days\\' growth, wasted flesh,\\r , short thick breath; it was the very ghost of Sikes.\\r , \\r , He laid his hand upon a chair which stood in the middle of the room,\\r , but shuddering as he was about to drop into it, and seeming to glance\\r , over his shoulder, dragged it back close to the wall--as close as it\\r , would go--and ground it against it--and sat down.\\r , \\r , Not a word had been exchanged.  He looked from one to another in\\r , silence.  If an eye were furtively raised and met his, it was instantly\\r , averted.  When his hollow voice broke silence, they all three started.\\r , They seemed never to have heard its tones before.\\r , \\r , \\'How came that dog here?\\' he asked.\\r , \\r , \\'Alone.  Three hours ago.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'To-night\\'s paper says that Fagin\\'s took.  Is it true, or a lie?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'True.\\'\\r , \\r , They were silent again.\\r , \\r , \\'Damn you all!\\' said Sikes, passing his hand across his forehead.\\r , \\r , \\'Have you nothing to say to me?\\'\\r , \\r , There was an uneasy movement among them, but nobody spoke.\\r , \\r , \\'You that keep this house,\\' said Sikes, turning his face to Crackit,\\r , \\'do you mean to sell me, or to let me lie here till this hunt is over?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You may stop here, if you think it safe,\\' returned the person\\r , addressed, after some hesitation.\\r , \\r , Sikes carried his eyes slowly up the wall behind him:  rather trying to\\r , turn his head than actually doing it:  and said, \\'Is--it--the body--is\\r , it buried?\\'\\r , \\r , They shook their heads.\\r , \\r , \\'Why isn\\'t it!\\' he retorted with the same glance behind him. \\'Wot do\\r , they keep such ugly things above the ground for?--Who\\'s that knocking?\\'\\r , \\r , Crackit intimated, by a motion of his hand as he left the room, that\\r , there was nothing to fear; and directly came back with Charley Bates\\r , behind him.  Sikes sat opposite the door, so that the moment the boy\\r , entered the room he encountered his figure.\\r , \\r , \\'Toby,\\' said the boy falling back, as Sikes turned his eyes towards\\r , him, \\'why didn\\'t you tell me this, downstairs?\\'\\r , \\r , There had been something so tremendous in the shrinking off of the\\r , three, that the wretched man was willing to propitiate even this lad.\\r , Accordingly he nodded, and made as though he would shake hands with him.\\r , \\r , \\'Let me go into some other room,\\' said the boy, retreating still\\r , farther.\\r , \\r , \\'Charley!\\' said Sikes, stepping forward.  \\'Don\\'t you--don\\'t you know\\r , me?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Don\\'t come nearer me,\\' answered the boy, still retreating, and\\r , looking, with horror in his eyes, upon the murderer\\'s face.  \\'You\\r , monster!\\'\\r , \\r , The man stopped half-way, and they looked at each other; but Sikes\\'s\\r , eyes sunk gradually to the ground.\\r , \\r , \\'Witness you three,\\' cried the boy shaking his clenched fist, and\\r , becoming more and more excited as he spoke. \\'Witness you three--I\\'m not\\r , afraid of him--if they come here after him, I\\'ll give him up; I will.\\r , I tell you out at once.  He may kill me for it if he likes, or if he\\r , dares, but if I am here I\\'ll give him up.  I\\'d give him up if he was to\\r , be boiled alive.  Murder! Help!  If there\\'s the pluck of a man among\\r , you three, you\\'ll help me.  Murder!  Help!  Down with him!\\'\\r , \\r , Pouring out these cries, and accompanying them with violent\\r , gesticulation, the boy actually threw himself, single-handed, upon the\\r , strong man, and in the intensity of his energy and the suddenness of\\r , his surprise, brought him heavily to the ground.\\r , \\r , The three spectators seemed quite stupefied.  They offered no\\r , interference, and the boy and man rolled on the ground together; the\\r , former, heedless of the blows that showered upon him, wrenching his\\r , hands tighter and tighter in the garments about the murderer\\'s breast,\\r , and never ceasing to call for help with all his might.\\r , \\r , The contest, however, was too unequal to last long.  Sikes had him\\r , down, and his knee was on his throat, when Crackit pulled him back with\\r , a look of alarm, and pointed to the window.  There were lights gleaming\\r , below, voices in loud and earnest conversation, the tramp of hurried\\r , footsteps--endless they seemed in number--crossing the nearest wooden\\r , bridge.  One man on horseback seemed to be among the crowd; for there\\r , was the noise of hoofs rattling on the uneven pavement.  The gleam of\\r , lights increased; the footsteps came more thickly and noisily on.\\r , Then, came a loud knocking at the door, and then a hoarse murmur from\\r , such a multitude of angry voices as would have made the boldest quail.\\r , \\r , \\'Help!\\' shrieked the boy in a voice that rent the air.\\r , \\r , \\'He\\'s here!  Break down the door!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'In the King\\'s name,\\' cried the voices without; and the hoarse cry\\r , arose again, but louder.\\r , \\r , \\'Break down the door!\\' screamed the boy.  \\'I tell you they\\'ll never\\r , open it.  Run straight to the room where the light is. Break down the\\r , door!\\'\\r , \\r , Strokes, thick and heavy, rattled upon the door and lower\\r , window-shutters as he ceased to speak, and a loud huzzah burst from the\\r , crowd; giving the listener, for the first time, some adequate idea of\\r , its immense extent.\\r , \\r , \\'Open the door of some place where I can lock this screeching\\r , Hell-babe,\\' cried Sikes fiercely; running to and fro, and dragging the\\r , boy, now, as easily as if he were an empty sack. \\'That door.  Quick!\\'\\r , He flung him in, bolted it, and turned the key.  \\'Is the downstairs\\r , door fast?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Double-locked and chained,\\' replied Crackit, who, with the other two\\r , men, still remained quite helpless and bewildered.\\r , \\r , \\'The panels--are they strong?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Lined with sheet-iron.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And the windows too?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, and the windows.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Damn you!\\' cried the desperate ruffian, throwing up the sash and\\r , menacing the crowd.  \\'Do your worst!  I\\'ll cheat you yet!\\'\\r , \\r , Of all the terrific yells that ever fell on mortal ears, none could\\r , exceed the cry of the infuriated throng.  Some shouted to those who\\r , were nearest to set the house on fire; others roared to the officers to\\r , shoot him dead.  Among them all, none showed such fury as the man on\\r , horseback, who, throwing himself out of the saddle, and bursting\\r , through the crowd as if he were parting water, cried, beneath the\\r , window, in a voice that rose above all others, \\'Twenty guineas to the\\r , man who brings a ladder!\\'\\r , \\r , The nearest voices took up the cry, and hundreds echoed it.  Some\\r , called for ladders, some for sledge-hammers; some ran with torches to\\r , and fro as if to seek them, and still came back and roared again; some\\r , spent their breath in impotent curses and execrations; some pressed\\r , forward with the ecstasy of madmen, and thus impeded the progress of\\r , those below; some among the boldest attempted to climb up by the\\r , water-spout and crevices in the wall; and all waved to and fro, in the\\r , darkness beneath, like a field of corn moved by an angry wind:  and\\r , joined from time to time in one loud furious roar.\\r , \\r , \\'The tide,\\' cried the murderer, as he staggered back into the room, and\\r , shut the faces out, \\'the tide was in as I came up. Give me a rope, a\\r , long rope.  They\\'re all in front.  I may drop into the Folly Ditch, and\\r , clear off that way.  Give me a rope, or I shall do three more murders\\r , and kill myself.\\'\\r , \\r , The panic-stricken men pointed to where such articles were kept; the\\r , murderer, hastily selecting the longest and strongest cord, hurried up\\r , to the house-top.\\r , \\r , All the window in the rear of the house had been long ago bricked up,\\r , except one small trap in the room where the boy was locked, and that\\r , was too small even for the passage of his body.  But, from this\\r , aperture, he had never ceased to call on those without, to guard the\\r , back; and thus, when the murderer emerged at last on the house-top by\\r , the door in the roof, a loud shout proclaimed the fact to those in\\r , front, who immediately began to pour round, pressing upon each other in\\r , an unbroken stream.\\r , \\r , He planted a board, which he had carried up with him for the purpose,\\r , so firmly against the door that it must be matter of great difficulty\\r , to open it from the inside; and creeping over the tiles, looked over\\r , the low parapet.\\r , \\r , The water was out, and the ditch a bed of mud.\\r , \\r , The crowd had been hushed during these few moments, watching his\\r , motions and doubtful of his purpose, but the instant they perceived it\\r , and knew it was defeated, they raised a cry of triumphant execration to\\r , which all their previous shouting had been whispers.  Again and again\\r , it rose.  Those who were at too great a distance to know its meaning,\\r , took up the sound; it echoed and re-echoed; it seemed as though the\\r , whole city had poured its population out to curse him.\\r , \\r , On pressed the people from the front--on, on, on, in a strong\\r , struggling current of angry faces, with here and there a glaring torch\\r , to lighten them up, and show them out in all their wrath and passion.\\r , The houses on the opposite side of the ditch had been entered by the\\r , mob; sashes were thrown up, or torn bodily out; there were tiers and\\r , tiers of faces in every window; cluster upon cluster of people clinging\\r , to every house-top.  Each little bridge (and there were three in sight)\\r , bent beneath the weight of the crowd upon it.  Still the current poured\\r , on to find some nook or hole from which to vent their shouts, and only\\r , for an instant see the wretch.\\r , \\r , \\'They have him now,\\' cried a man on the nearest bridge. \\'Hurrah!\\'\\r , \\r , The crowd grew light with uncovered heads; and again the shout uprose.\\r , \\r , \\'I will give fifty pounds,\\' cried an old gentleman from the same\\r , quarter, \\'to the man who takes him alive.  I will remain here, till he\\r , come to ask me for it.\\'\\r , \\r , There was another roar.  At this moment the word was passed among the\\r , crowd that the door was forced at last, and that he who had first\\r , called for the ladder had mounted into the room.  The stream abruptly\\r , turned, as this intelligence ran from mouth to mouth; and the people at\\r , the windows, seeing those upon the bridges pouring back, quitted their\\r , stations, and running into the street, joined the concourse that now\\r , thronged pell-mell to the spot they had left:  each man crushing and\\r , striving with his neighbor, and all panting with impatience to get near\\r , the door, and look upon the criminal as the officers brought him out.\\r , The cries and shrieks of those who were pressed almost to suffocation,\\r , or trampled down and trodden under foot in the confusion, were\\r , dreadful; the narrow ways were completely blocked up; and at this time,\\r , between the rush of some to regain the space in front of the house, and\\r , the unavailing struggles of others to extricate themselves from the\\r , mass, the immediate attention was distracted from the murderer,\\r , although the universal eagerness for his capture was, if possible,\\r , increased.\\r , \\r , The man had shrunk down, thoroughly quelled by the ferocity of the\\r , crowd, and the impossibility of escape; but seeing this sudden change\\r , with no less rapidity than it had occurred, he sprang upon his feet,\\r , determined to make one last effort for his life by dropping into the\\r , ditch, and, at the risk of being stifled, endeavouring to creep away in\\r , the darkness and confusion.\\r , \\r , Roused into new strength and energy, and stimulated by the noise within\\r , the house which announced that an entrance had really been effected, he\\r , set his foot against the stack of chimneys, fastened one end of the\\r , rope tightly and firmly round it, and with the other made a strong\\r , running noose by the aid of his hands and teeth almost in a second.  He\\r , could let himself down by the cord to within a less distance of the\\r , ground than his own height, and had his knife ready in his hand to cut\\r , it then and drop.\\r , \\r , At the very instant when he brought the loop over his head previous to\\r , slipping it beneath his arm-pits, and when the old gentleman\\r , before-mentioned (who had clung so tight to the railing of the bridge\\r , as to resist the force of the crowd, and retain his position) earnestly\\r , warned those about him that the man was about to lower himself down--at\\r , that very instant the murderer, looking behind him on the roof, threw\\r , his arms above his head, and uttered a yell of terror.\\r , \\r , \\'The eyes again!\\' he cried in an unearthly screech.\\r , \\r , Staggering as if struck by lightning, he lost his balance and tumbled\\r , over the parapet.  The noose was on his neck. It ran up with his\\r , weight, tight as a bow-string, and swift as the arrow it speeds.  He\\r , fell for five-and-thirty feet.  There was a sudden jerk, a terrific\\r , convulsion of the limbs; and there he hung, with the open knife\\r , clenched in his stiffening hand.\\r , \\r , The old chimney quivered with the shock, but stood it bravely. The\\r , murderer swung lifeless against the wall; and the boy, thrusting aside\\r , the dangling body which obscured his view, called to the people to come\\r , and take him out, for God\\'s sake.\\r , \\r , A dog, which had lain concealed till now, ran backwards and forwards on\\r , the parapet with a dismal howl, and collecting himself for a spring,\\r , jumped for the dead man\\'s shoulders. Missing his aim, he fell into the\\r , ditch, turning completely over as he went; and striking his head\\r , against a stone, dashed out his brains.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER LI\\r , \\r , AFFORDING AN EXPLANATION OF MORE MYSTERIES THAN ONE, AND COMPREHENDING\\r , A PROPOSAL OF MARRIAGE WITH NO WORD OF SETTLEMENT OR PIN-MONEY\\r , \\r , The events narrated in the last chapter were yet but two days old, when\\r , Oliver found himself, at three o\\'clock in the afternoon, in a\\r , travelling-carriage rolling fast towards his native town.  Mrs. Maylie,\\r , and Rose, and Mrs. Bedwin, and the good doctor were with him:  and Mr.\\r , Brownlow followed in a post-chaise, accompanied by one other person\\r , whose name had not been mentioned.\\r , \\r , They had not talked much upon the way; for Oliver was in a flutter of\\r , agitation and uncertainty which deprived him of the power of collecting\\r , his thoughts, and almost of speech, and appeared to have scarcely less\\r , effect on his companions, who shared it, in at least an equal degree.\\r , He and the two ladies had been very carefully made acquainted by Mr.\\r , Brownlow with the nature of the admissions which had been forced from\\r , Monks; and although they knew that the object of their present journey\\r , was to complete the work which had been so well begun, still the whole\\r , matter was enveloped in enough of doubt and mystery to leave them in\\r , endurance of the most intense suspense.\\r , \\r , The same kind friend had, with Mr. Losberne\\'s assistance, cautiously\\r , stopped all channels of communication through which they could receive\\r , intelligence of the dreadful occurrences that so recently taken place.\\r , \\'It was quite true,\\' he said, \\'that they must know them before long,\\r , but it might be at a better time than the present, and it could not be\\r , at a worse.\\'  So, they travelled on in silence:  each busied with\\r , reflections on the object which had brought them together:  and no one\\r , disposed to give utterance to the thoughts which crowded upon all.\\r , \\r , But if Oliver, under these influences, had remained silent while they\\r , journeyed towards his birth-place by a road he had never seen, how the\\r , whole current of his recollections ran back to old times, and what a\\r , crowd of emotions were wakened up in his breast, when they turned into\\r , that which he had traversed on foot:  a poor houseless, wandering boy,\\r , without a friend to help him, or a roof to shelter his head.\\r , \\r , \\'See there, there!\\' cried Oliver, eagerly clasping the hand of Rose,\\r , and pointing out at the carriage window; \\'that\\'s the stile I came over;\\r , there are the hedges I crept behind, for fear any one should overtake\\r , me and force me back!  Yonder is the path across the fields, leading to\\r , the old house where I was a little child!  Oh Dick, Dick, my dear old\\r , friend, if I could only see you now!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You will see him soon,\\' replied Rose, gently taking his folded hands\\r , between her own.  \\'You shall tell him how happy you are, and how rich\\r , you have grown, and that in all your happiness you have none so great\\r , as the coming back to make him happy too.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, yes,\\' said Oliver, \\'and we\\'ll--we\\'ll take him away from here, and\\r , have him clothed and taught, and send him to some quiet country place\\r , where he may grow strong and well,--shall we?\\'\\r , \\r , Rose nodded \\'yes,\\' for the boy was smiling through such happy tears\\r , that she could not speak.\\r , \\r , \\'You will be kind and good to him, for you are to every one,\\' said\\r , Oliver.  \\'It will make you cry, I know, to hear what he can tell; but\\r , never mind, never mind, it will be all over, and you will smile\\r , again--I know that too--to think how changed he is; you did the same\\r , with me.  He said \"God bless you\" to me when I ran away,\\' cried the boy\\r , with a burst of affectionate emotion; \\'and I will say \"God bless you\"\\r , now, and show him how I love him for it!\\'\\r , \\r , As they approached the town, and at length drove through its narrow\\r , streets, it became matter of no small difficulty to restrain the boy\\r , within reasonable bounds.  There was Sowerberry\\'s the undertaker\\'s just\\r , as it used to be, only smaller and less imposing in appearance than he\\r , remembered it--there were all the well-known shops and houses, with\\r , almost every one of which he had some slight incident connected--there\\r , was Gamfield\\'s cart, the very cart he used to have, standing at the old\\r , public-house door--there was the workhouse, the dreary prison of his\\r , youthful days, with its dismal windows frowning on the street--there\\r , was the same lean porter standing at the gate, at sight of whom Oliver\\r , involuntarily shrunk back, and then laughed at himself for being so\\r , foolish, then cried, then laughed again--there were scores of faces at\\r , the doors and windows that he knew quite well--there was nearly\\r , everything as if he had left it but yesterday, and all his recent life\\r , had been but a happy dream.\\r , \\r , But it was pure, earnest, joyful reality.  They drove straight to the\\r , door of the chief hotel (which Oliver used to stare up at, with awe,\\r , and think a mighty palace, but which had somehow fallen off in grandeur\\r , and size); and here was Mr. Grimwig all ready to receive them, kissing\\r , the young lady, and the old one too, when they got out of the coach, as\\r , if he were the grandfather of the whole party, all smiles and kindness,\\r , and not offering to eat his head--no, not once; not even when he\\r , contradicted a very old postboy about the nearest road to London, and\\r , maintained he knew it best, though he had only come that way once, and\\r , that time fast asleep.  There was dinner prepared, and there were\\r , bedrooms ready, and everything was arranged as if by magic.\\r , \\r , Notwithstanding all this, when the hurry of the first half-hour was\\r , over, the same silence and constraint prevailed that had marked their\\r , journey down.  Mr. Brownlow did not join them at dinner, but remained\\r , in a separate room.  The two other gentlemen hurried in and out with\\r , anxious faces, and, during the short intervals when they were present,\\r , conversed apart.  Once, Mrs. Maylie was called away, and after being\\r , absent for nearly an hour, returned with eyes swollen with weeping.\\r , All these things made Rose and Oliver, who were not in any new secrets,\\r , nervous and uncomfortable.  They sat wondering, in silence; or, if they\\r , exchanged a few words, spoke in whispers, as if they were afraid to\\r , hear the sound of their own voices.\\r , \\r , At length, when nine o\\'clock had come, and they began to think they\\r , were to hear no more that night, Mr. Losberne and Mr. Grimwig entered\\r , the room, followed by Mr. Brownlow and a man whom Oliver almost\\r , shrieked with surprise to see; for they told him it was his brother,\\r , and it was the same man he had met at the market-town, and seen looking\\r , in with Fagin at the window of his little room.  Monks cast a look of\\r , hate, which, even then, he could not dissemble, at the astonished boy,\\r , and sat down near the door.  Mr. Brownlow, who had papers in his hand,\\r , walked to a table near which Rose and Oliver were seated.\\r , \\r , \\'This is a painful task,\\' said he, \\'but these declarations, which have\\r , been signed in London before many gentlemen, must be in substance\\r , repeated here.  I would have spared you the degradation, but we must\\r , hear them from your own lips before we part, and you know why.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Go on,\\' said the person addressed, turning away his face. \\'Quick.  I\\r , have almost done enough, I think.  Don\\'t keep me here.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'This child,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, drawing Oliver to him, and laying his\\r , hand upon his head, \\'is your half-brother; the illegitimate son of your\\r , father, my dear friend Edwin Leeford, by poor young Agnes Fleming, who\\r , died in giving him birth.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' said Monks, scowling at the trembling boy:  the beating of whose\\r , heart he might have heard.  \\'That is the bastard child.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The term you use,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, sternly, \\'is a reproach to those\\r , long since passed beyond the feeble censure of the world. It reflects\\r , disgrace on no one living, except you who use it. Let that pass.  He\\r , was born in this town.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'In the workhouse of this town,\\' was the sullen reply. \\'You have the\\r , story there.\\'  He pointed impatiently to the papers as he spoke.\\r , \\r , \\'I must have it here, too,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, looking round upon the\\r , listeners.\\r , \\r , \\'Listen then!  You!\\' returned Monks.  \\'His father being taken ill at\\r , Rome, was joined by his wife, my mother, from whom he had been long\\r , separated, who went from Paris and took me with her--to look after his\\r , property, for what I know, for she had no great affection for him, nor\\r , he for her.  He knew nothing of us, for his senses were gone, and he\\r , slumbered on till next day, when he died.  Among the papers in his\\r , desk, were two, dated on the night his illness first came on, directed\\r , to yourself\\'; he addressed himself to Mr. Brownlow; \\'and enclosed in a\\r , few short lines to you, with an intimation on the cover of the package\\r , that it was not to be forwarded till after he was dead.  One of these\\r , papers was a letter to this girl Agnes; the other a will.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What of the letter?\\' asked Mr. Brownlow.\\r , \\r , \\'The letter?--A sheet of paper crossed and crossed again, with a\\r , penitent confession, and prayers to God to help her.  He had palmed a\\r , tale on the girl that some secret mystery--to be explained one\\r , day--prevented his marrying her just then; and so she had gone on,\\r , trusting patiently to him, until she trusted too far, and lost what\\r , none could ever give her back.  She was, at that time, within a few\\r , months of her confinement.  He told her all he had meant to do, to hide\\r , her shame, if he had lived, and prayed her, if he died, not to curse\\r , his memory, or think the consequences of their sin would be visited on\\r , her or their young child; for all the guilt was his.  He reminded her\\r , of the day he had given her the little locket and the ring with her\\r , christian name engraved upon it, and a blank left for that which he\\r , hoped one day to have bestowed upon her--prayed her yet to keep it, and\\r , wear it next her heart, as she had done before--and then ran on,\\r , wildly, in the same words, over and over again, as if he had gone\\r , distracted.  I believe he had.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The will,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, as Oliver\\'s tears fell fast.\\r , \\r , Monks was silent.\\r , \\r , \\'The will,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, speaking for him, \\'was in the same\\r , spirit as the letter.  He talked of miseries which his wife had brought\\r , upon him; of the rebellious disposition, vice, malice, and premature\\r , bad passions of you his only son, who had been trained to hate him; and\\r , left you, and your mother, each an annuity of eight hundred pounds.\\r , The bulk of his property he divided into two equal portions--one for\\r , Agnes Fleming, and the other for their child, if it should be born\\r , alive, and ever come of age.  If it were a girl, it was to inherit the\\r , money unconditionally; but if a boy, only on the stipulation that in\\r , his minority he should never have stained his name with any public act\\r , of dishonour, meanness, cowardice, or wrong.  He did this, he said, to\\r , mark his confidence in the other, and his conviction--only strengthened\\r , by approaching death--that the child would share her gentle heart, and\\r , noble nature.  If he were disappointed in this expectation, then the\\r , money was to come to you:  for then, and not till then, when both\\r , children were equal, would he recognise your prior claim upon his\\r , purse, who had none upon his heart, but had, from an infant, repulsed\\r , him with coldness and aversion.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'My mother,\\' said Monks, in a louder tone, \\'did what a woman should\\r , have done.  She burnt this will.  The letter never reached its\\r , destination; but that, and other proofs, she kept, in case they ever\\r , tried to lie away the blot.  The girl\\'s father had the truth from her\\r , with every aggravation that her violent hate--I love her for it\\r , now--could add.  Goaded by shame and dishonour he fled with his\\r , children into a remote corner of Wales, changing his very name that his\\r , friends might never know of his retreat; and here, no great while\\r , afterwards, he was found dead in his bed.  The girl had left her home,\\r , in secret, some weeks before; he had searched for her, on foot, in\\r , every town and village near; it was on the night when he returned home,\\r , assured that she had destroyed herself, to hide her shame and his, that\\r , his old heart broke.\\'\\r , \\r , There was a short silence here, until Mr. Brownlow took up the thread\\r , of the narrative.\\r , \\r , \\'Years after this,\\' he said, \\'this man\\'s--Edward Leeford\\'s--mother came\\r , to me.  He had left her, when only eighteen; robbed her of jewels and\\r , money; gambled, squandered, forged, and fled to London:  where for two\\r , years he had associated with the lowest outcasts.  She was sinking\\r , under a painful and incurable disease, and wished to recover him before\\r , she died.  Inquiries were set on foot, and strict searches made. They\\r , were unavailing for a long time, but ultimately successful; and he went\\r , back with her to France.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'There she died,\\' said Monks, \\'after a lingering illness; and, on her\\r , death-bed, she bequeathed these secrets to me, together with her\\r , unquenchable and deadly hatred of all whom they involved--though she\\r , need not have left me that, for I had inherited it long before.  She\\r , would not believe that the girl had destroyed herself, and the child\\r , too, but was filled with the impression that a male child had been\\r , born, and was alive.  I swore to her, if ever it crossed my path, to\\r , hunt it down; never to let it rest; to pursue it with the bitterest and\\r , most unrelenting animosity; to vent upon it the hatred that I deeply\\r , felt, and to spit upon the empty vaunt of that insulting will by\\r , draggin it, if I could, to the very gallows-foot.  She was right. He\\r , came in my way at last.  I began well; and, but for babbling drabs, I\\r , would have finished as I began!\\'\\r , \\r , As the villain folded his arms tight together, and muttered curses on\\r , himself in the impotence of baffled malice, Mr. Brownlow turned to the\\r , terrified group beside him, and explained that the Jew, who had been\\r , his old accomplice and confidant, had a large reward for keeping Oliver\\r , ensnared:  of which some part was to be given up, in the event of his\\r , being rescued:  and that a dispute on this head had led to their visit\\r , to the country house for the purpose of identifying him.\\r , \\r , \\'The locket and ring?\\' said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'I bought them from the man and woman I told you of, who stole them\\r , from the nurse, who stole them from the corpse,\\' answered Monks without\\r , raising his eyes.  \\'You know what became of them.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Brownlow merely nodded to Mr. Grimwig, who disappearing with great\\r , alacrity, shortly returned, pushing in Mrs. Bumble, and dragging her\\r , unwilling consort after him.\\r , \\r , \\'Do my hi\\'s deceive me!\\' cried Mr. Bumble, with ill-feigned enthusiasm,\\r , \\'or is that little Oliver?  Oh O-li-ver, if you know\\'d how I\\'ve been\\r , a-grieving for you--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Hold your tongue, fool,\\' murmured Mrs. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'Isn\\'t natur, natur, Mrs. Bumble?\\' remonstrated the workhouse master.\\r , \\'Can\\'t I be supposed to feel--_I_ as brought him up porochially--when I\\r , see him a-setting here among ladies and gentlemen of the very affablest\\r , description!  I always loved that boy as if he\\'d been my--my--my own\\r , grandfather,\\' said Mr. Bumble, halting for an appropriate comparison.\\r , \\'Master Oliver, my dear, you remember the blessed gentleman in the\\r , white waistcoat?  Ah! he went to heaven last week, in a oak coffin with\\r , plated handles, Oliver.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Come, sir,\\' said Mr. Grimwig, tartly; \\'suppress your feelings.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I will do my endeavours, sir,\\' replied Mr. Bumble.  \\'How do you do,\\r , sir?  I hope you are very well.\\'\\r , \\r , This salutation was addressed to Mr. Brownlow, who had stepped up to\\r , within a short distance of the respectable couple.  He inquired, as he\\r , pointed to Monks,\\r , \\r , \\'Do you know that person?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' replied Mrs. Bumble flatly.\\r , \\r , \\'Perhaps _you_ don\\'t?\\' said Mr. Brownlow, addressing her spouse.\\r , \\r , \\'I never saw him in all my life,\\' said Mr. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'Nor sold him anything, perhaps?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' replied Mrs. Bumble.\\r , \\r , \\'You never had, perhaps, a certain gold locket and ring?\\' said Mr.\\r , Brownlow.\\r , \\r , \\'Certainly not,\\' replied the matron.  \\'Why are we brought here to\\r , answer to such nonsense as this?\\'\\r , \\r , Again Mr. Brownlow nodded to Mr. Grimwig; and again that gentleman\\r , limped away with extraordinary readiness.  But not again did he return\\r , with a stout man and wife; for this time, he led in two palsied women,\\r , who shook and tottered as they walked.\\r , \\r , \\'You shut the door the night old Sally died,\\' said the foremost one,\\r , raising her shrivelled hand, \\'but you couldn\\'t shut out the sound, nor\\r , stop the chinks.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No, no,\\' said the other, looking round her and wagging her toothless\\r , jaws.  \\'No, no, no.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'We heard her try to tell you what she\\'d done, and saw you take a paper\\r , from her hand, and watched you too, next day, to the pawnbroker\\'s\\r , shop,\\' said the first.\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' added the second, \\'and it was a \"locket and gold ring.\" We found\\r , out that, and saw it given you.  We were by.  Oh! we were by.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And we know more than that,\\' resumed the first, \\'for she told us\\r , often, long ago, that the young mother had told her that, feeling she\\r , should never get over it, she was on her way, at the time that she was\\r , taken ill, to die near the grave of the father of the child.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Would you like to see the pawnbroker himself?\\' asked Mr. Grimwig with\\r , a motion towards the door.\\r , \\r , \\'No,\\' replied the woman; \\'if he\\'--she pointed to Monks--\\'has been coward\\r , enough to confess, as I see he has, and you have sounded all these hags\\r , till you have found the right ones, I have nothing more to say.  I\\r , _did_ sell them, and they\\'re where you\\'ll never get them.  What then?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow, \\'except that it remains for us to take\\r , care that neither of you is employed in a situation of trust again.\\r , You may leave the room.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I hope,\\' said Mr. Bumble, looking about him with great ruefulness, as\\r , Mr. Grimwig disappeared with the two old women: \\'I hope that this\\r , unfortunate little circumstance will not deprive me of my porochial\\r , office?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Indeed it will,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow.  \\'You may make up your mind to\\r , that, and think yourself well off besides.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It was all Mrs. Bumble.  She _would_ do it,\\' urged Mr. Bumble; first\\r , looking round to ascertain that his partner had left the room.\\r , \\r , \\'That is no excuse,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow.  \\'You were present on the\\r , occasion of the destruction of these trinkets, and indeed are the more\\r , guilty of the two, in the eye of the law; for the law supposes that\\r , your wife acts under your direction.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If the law supposes that,\\' said Mr. Bumble, squeezing his hat\\r , emphatically in both hands, \\'the law is a ass--a idiot.  If that\\'s the\\r , eye of the law, the law is a bachelor; and the worst I wish the law is,\\r , that his eye may be opened by experience--by experience.\\'\\r , \\r , Laying great stress on the repetition of these two words, Mr. Bumble\\r , fixed his hat on very tight, and putting his hands in his pockets,\\r , followed his helpmate downstairs.\\r , \\r , \\'Young lady,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, turning to Rose, \\'give me your hand.\\r , Do not tremble.  You need not fear to hear the few remaining words we\\r , have to say.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'If they have--I do not know how they can, but if they have--any\\r , reference to me,\\' said Rose, \\'pray let me hear them at some other time.\\r , I have not strength or spirits now.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nay,\\' returned the old gentlman, drawing her arm through his; \\'you\\r , have more fortitude than this, I am sure.  Do you know this young lady,\\r , sir?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes,\\' replied Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'I never saw you before,\\' said Rose faintly.\\r , \\r , \\'I have seen you often,\\' returned Monks.\\r , \\r , \\'The father of the unhappy Agnes had _two_ daughters,\\' said Mr.\\r , Brownlow.  \\'What was the fate of the other--the child?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The child,\\' replied Monks, \\'when her father died in a strange place,\\r , in a strange name, without a letter, book, or scrap of paper that\\r , yielded the faintest clue by which his friends or relatives could be\\r , traced--the child was taken by some wretched cottagers, who reared it\\r , as their own.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Go on,\\' said Mr. Brownlow, signing to Mrs. Maylie to approach. \\'Go on!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You couldn\\'t find the spot to which these people had repaired,\\' said\\r , Monks, \\'but where friendship fails, hatred will often force a way.  My\\r , mother found it, after a year of cunning search--ay, and found the\\r , child.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'She took it, did she?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'No.  The people were poor and began to sicken--at least the man\\r , did--of their fine humanity; so she left it with them, giving them a\\r , small present of money which would not last long, and promised more,\\r , which she never meant to send.  She didn\\'t quite rely, however, on\\r , their discontent and poverty for the child\\'s unhappiness, but told the\\r , history of the sister\\'s shame, with such alterations as suited her;\\r , bade them take good heed of the child, for she came of bad blood; and\\r , told them she was illegitimate, and sure to go wrong at one time or\\r , other.  The circumstances countenanced all this; the people believed\\r , it; and there the child dragged on an existence, miserable enough even\\r , to satisfy us, until a widow lady, residing, then, at Chester, saw the\\r , girl by chance, pitied her, and took her home.  There was some cursed\\r , spell, I think, against us; for in spite of all our efforts she\\r , remained there and was happy.  I lost sight of her, two or three years\\r , ago, and saw her no more until a few months back.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Do you see her now?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes.  Leaning on your arm.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'But not the less my niece,\\' cried Mrs. Maylie, folding the fainting\\r , girl in her arms; \\'not the less my dearest child.  I would not lose her\\r , now, for all the treasures of the world.  My sweet companion, my own\\r , dear girl!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The only friend I ever had,\\' cried Rose, clinging to her. \\'The\\r , kindest, best of friends.  My heart will burst.  I cannot bear all\\r , this.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You have borne more, and have been, through all, the best and gentlest\\r , creature that ever shed happiness on every one she knew,\\' said Mrs.\\r , Maylie, embracing her tenderly. \\'Come, come, my love, remember who this\\r , is who waits to clasp you in his arms, poor child!  See here--look,\\r , look, my dear!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not aunt,\\' cried Oliver, throwing his arms about her neck; \\'I\\'ll never\\r , call her aunt--sister, my own dear sister, that something taught my\\r , heart to love so dearly from the first!  Rose, dear, darling Rose!\\'\\r , \\r , Let the tears which fell, and the broken words which were exchanged in\\r , the long close embrace between the orphans, be sacred.  A father,\\r , sister, and mother, were gained, and lost, in that one moment.  Joy and\\r , grief were mingled in the cup; but there were no bitter tears:  for\\r , even grief itself arose so softened, and clothed in such sweet and\\r , tender recollections, that it became a solemn pleasure, and lost all\\r , character of pain.\\r , \\r , They were a long, long time alone.  A soft tap at the door, at length\\r , announced that some one was without.  Oliver opened it, glided away,\\r , and gave place to Harry Maylie.\\r , \\r , \\'I know it all,\\' he said, taking a seat beside the lovely girl. \\'Dear\\r , Rose, I know it all.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I am not here by accident,\\' he added after a lengthened silence; \\'nor\\r , have I heard all this to-night, for I knew it yesterday--only\\r , yesterday.  Do you guess that I have come to remind you of a promise?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Stay,\\' said Rose.  \\'You _do_ know all.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'All.  You gave me leave, at any time within a year, to renew the\\r , subject of our last discourse.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I did.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not to press you to alter your determination,\\' pursued the young man,\\r , \\'but to hear you repeat it, if you would. I was to lay whatever of\\r , station or fortune I might possess at your feet, and if you still\\r , adhered to your former determination, I pledged myself, by no word or\\r , act, to seek to change it.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The same reasons which influenced me then, will influence me now,\\'\\r , said Rose firmly.  \\'If I ever owed a strict and rigid duty to her,\\r , whose goodness saved me from a life of indigence and suffering, when\\r , should I ever feel it, as I should to-night?  It is a struggle,\\' said\\r , Rose, \\'but one I am proud to make; it is a pang, but one my heart shall\\r , bear.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'The disclosure of to-night,\\'--Harry began.\\r , \\r , \\'The disclosure of to-night,\\' replied Rose softly, \\'leaves me in the\\r , same position, with reference to you, as that in which I stood before.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You harden your heart against me, Rose,\\' urged her lover.\\r , \\r , \\'Oh Harry, Harry,\\' said the young lady, bursting into tears; \\'I wish I\\r , could, and spare myself this pain.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Then why inflict it on yourself?\\' said Harry, taking her hand. \\'Think,\\r , dear Rose, think what you have heard to-night.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'And what have I heard!  What have I heard!\\' cried Rose. \\'That a sense\\r , of his deep disgrace so worked upon my own father that he shunned\\r , all--there, we have said enough, Harry, we have said enough.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Not yet, not yet,\\' said the young man, detaining her as she rose.  \\'My\\r , hopes, my wishes, prospects, feeling:  every thought in life except my\\r , love for you:  have undergone a change.  I offer you, now, no\\r , distinction among a bustling crowd; no mingling with a world of malice\\r , and detraction, where the blood is called into honest cheeks by aught\\r , but real disgrace and shame; but a home--a heart and home--yes, dearest\\r , Rose, and those, and those alone, are all I have to offer.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'What do you mean!\\' she faltered.\\r , \\r , \\'I mean but this--that when I left you last, I left you with a firm\\r , determination to level all fancied barriers between yourself and me;\\r , resolved that if my world could not be yours, I would make yours mine;\\r , that no pride of birth should curl the lip at you, for I would turn\\r , from it.  This I have done.  Those who have shrunk from me because of\\r , this, have shrunk from you, and proved you so far right.  Such power\\r , and patronage:  such relatives of influence and rank:  as smiled upon\\r , me then, look coldly now; but there are smiling fields and waving trees\\r , in England\\'s richest county; and by one village church--mine, Rose, my\\r , own!--there stands a rustic dwelling which you can make me prouder of,\\r , than all the hopes I have renounced, measured a thousandfold.  This is\\r , my rank and station now, and here I lay it down!\\'\\r , \\r ,       *      *      *      *      *\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s a trying thing waiting supper for lovers,\\' said Mr. Grimwig,\\r , waking up, and pulling his pocket-handkerchief from over his head.\\r , \\r , Truth to tell, the supper had been waiting a most unreasonable time.\\r , Neither Mrs. Maylie, nor Harry, nor Rose (who all came in together),\\r , could offer a word in extenuation.\\r , \\r , \\'I had serious thoughts of eating my head to-night,\\' said Mr. Grimwig,\\r , \\'for I began to think I should get nothing else.  I\\'ll take the\\r , liberty, if you\\'ll allow me, of saluting the bride that is to be.\\'\\r , \\r , Mr. Grimwig lost no time in carrying this notice into effect upon the\\r , blushing girl; and the example, being contagious, was followed both by\\r , the doctor and Mr. Brownlow:  some people affirm that Harry Maylie had\\r , been observed to set it, originally, in a dark room adjoining; but the\\r , best authorities consider this downright scandal:  he being young and a\\r , clergyman.\\r , \\r , \\'Oliver, my child,\\' said Mrs. Maylie, \\'where have you been, and why do\\r , you look so sad?  There are tears stealing down your face at this\\r , moment.  What is the matter?\\'\\r , \\r , It is a world of disappointment:  often to the hopes we most cherish,\\r , and hopes that do our nature the greatest honour.\\r , \\r , Poor Dick was dead!\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER LII\\r , \\r , FAGIN\\'S LAST NIGHT ALIVE\\r , \\r , The court was paved, from floor to roof, with human faces. Inquisitive\\r , and eager eyes peered from every inch of space. From the rail before\\r , the dock, away into the sharpest angle of the smallest corner in the\\r , galleries, all looks were fixed upon one man--Fagin.  Before him and\\r , behind:  above, below, on the right and on the left:  he seemed to\\r , stand surrounded by a firmament, all bright with gleaming eyes.\\r , \\r , He stood there, in all this glare of living light, with one hand\\r , resting on the wooden slab before him, the other held to his ear, and\\r , his head thrust forward to enable him to catch with greater\\r , distinctness every word that fell from the presiding judge, who was\\r , delivering his charge to the jury.  At times, he turned his eyes\\r , sharply upon them to observe the effect of the slightest featherweight\\r , in his favour; and when the points against him were stated with\\r , terrible distinctness, looked towards his counsel, in mute appeal that\\r , he would, even then, urge something in his behalf.  Beyond these\\r , manifestations of anxiety, he stirred not hand or foot.  He had\\r , scarcely moved since the trial began; and now that the judge ceased to\\r , speak, he still remained in the same strained attitude of close\\r , attention, with his gaze bent on him, as though he listened still.\\r , \\r , A slight bustle in the court, recalled him to himself.  Looking round,\\r , he saw that the juryman had turned together, to consider their verdict.\\r , As his eyes wandered to the gallery, he could see the people rising\\r , above each other to see his face:  some hastily applying their glasses\\r , to their eyes:  and others whispering their neighbours with looks\\r , expressive of abhorrence.  A few there were, who seemed unmindful of\\r , him, and looked only to the jury, in impatient wonder how they could\\r , delay.  But in no one face--not even among the women, of whom there\\r , were many there--could he read the faintest sympathy with himself, or\\r , any feeling but one of all-absorbing interest that he should be\\r , condemned.\\r , \\r , As he saw all this in one bewildered glance, the deathlike stillness\\r , came again, and looking back he saw that the jurymen had turned towards\\r , the judge.  Hush!\\r , \\r , They only sought permission to retire.\\r , \\r , He looked, wistfully, into their faces, one by one when they passed\\r , out, as though to see which way the greater number leant; but that was\\r , fruitless.  The jailer touched him on the shoulder. He followed\\r , mechanically to the end of the dock, and sat down on a chair.  The man\\r , pointed it out, or he would not have seen it.\\r , \\r , He looked up into the gallery again.  Some of the people were eating,\\r , and some fanning themselves with handkerchiefs; for the crowded place\\r , was very hot.  There was one young man sketching his face in a little\\r , note-book.  He wondered whether it was like, and looked on when the\\r , artist broke his pencil-point, and made another with his knife, as any\\r , idle spectator might have done.\\r , \\r , In the same way, when he turned his eyes towards the judge, his mind\\r , began to busy itself with the fashion of his dress, and what it cost,\\r , and how he put it on.  There was an old fat gentleman on the bench,\\r , too, who had gone out, some half an hour before, and now come back.  He\\r , wondered within himself whether this man had been to get his dinner,\\r , what he had had, and where he had had it; and pursued this train of\\r , careless thought until some new object caught his eye and roused\\r , another.\\r , \\r , Not that, all this time, his mind was, for an instant, free from one\\r , oppressive overwhelming sense of the grave that opened at his feet; it\\r , was ever present to him, but in a vague and general way, and he could\\r , not fix his thoughts upon it.  Thus, even while he trembled, and turned\\r , burning hot at the idea of speedy death, he fell to counting the iron\\r , spikes before him, and wondering how the head of one had been broken\\r , off, and whether they would mend it, or leave it as it was.  Then, he\\r , thought of all the horrors of the gallows and the scaffold--and stopped\\r , to watch a man sprinkling the floor to cool it--and then went on to\\r , think again.\\r , \\r , At length there was a cry of silence, and a breathless look from all\\r , towards the door.  The jury returned, and passed him close. He could\\r , glean nothing from their faces; they might as well have been of stone.\\r , Perfect stillness ensued--not a rustle--not a breath--Guilty.\\r , \\r , The building rang with a tremendous shout, and another, and another,\\r , and then it echoed loud groans, that gathered strength as they swelled\\r , out, like angry thunder.  It was a peal of joy from the populace\\r , outside, greeting the news that he would die on Monday.\\r , \\r , The noise subsided, and he was asked if he had anything to say why\\r , sentence of death should not be passed upon him. He had resumed his\\r , listening attitude, and looked intently at his questioner while the\\r , demand was made; but it was twice repeated before he seemed to hear it,\\r , and then he only muttered that he was an old man--an old man--and so,\\r , dropping into a whisper, was silent again.\\r , \\r , The judge assumed the black cap, and the prisoner still stood with the\\r , same air and gesture.  A woman in the gallery, uttered some\\r , exclamation, called forth by this dread solemnity; he looked hastily up\\r , as if angry at the interruption, and bent forward yet more attentively.\\r , The address was solemn and impressive; the sentence fearful to hear.\\r , But he stood, like a marble figure, without the motion of a nerve.  His\\r , haggard face was still thrust forward, his under-jaw hanging down, and\\r , his eyes staring out before him, when the jailer put his hand upon his\\r , arm, and beckoned him away.  He gazed stupidly about him for an\\r , instant, and obeyed.\\r , \\r , They led him through a paved room under the court, where some prisoners\\r , were waiting till their turns came, and others were talking to their\\r , friends, who crowded round a grate which looked into the open yard.\\r , There was nobody there to speak to _him_; but, as he passed, the\\r , prisoners fell back to render him more visible to the people who were\\r , clinging to the bars:  and they assailed him with opprobrious names,\\r , and screeched and hissed.  He shook his fist, and would have spat upon\\r , them; but his conductors hurried him on, through a gloomy passage\\r , lighted by a few dim lamps, into the interior of the prison.\\r , \\r , Here, he was searched, that he might not have about him the means of\\r , anticipating the law; this ceremony performed, they led him to one of\\r , the condemned cells, and left him there--alone.\\r , \\r , He sat down on a stone bench opposite the door, which served for seat\\r , and bedstead; and casting his blood-shot eyes upon the ground, tried to\\r , collect his thoughts. After awhile, he began to remember a few\\r , disjointed fragments of what the judge had said: though it had seemed\\r , to him, at the time, that he could not hear a word.  These gradually\\r , fell into their proper places, and by degrees suggested more:  so that\\r , in a little time he had the whole, almost as it was delivered.  To be\\r , hanged by the neck, till he was dead--that was the end.  To be hanged\\r , by the neck till he was dead.\\r , \\r , As it came on very dark, he began to think of all the men he had known\\r , who had died upon the scaffold; some of them through his means.  They\\r , rose up, in such quick succession, that he could hardly count them.  He\\r , had seen some of them die,--and had joked too, because they died with\\r , prayers upon their lips.  With what a rattling noise the drop went\\r , down; and how suddenly they changed, from strong and vigorous men to\\r , dangling heaps of clothes!\\r , \\r , Some of them might have inhabited that very cell--sat upon that very\\r , spot.  It was very dark; why didn\\'t they bring a light?  The cell had\\r , been built for many years.  Scores of men must have passed their last\\r , hours there.  It was like sitting in a vault strewn with dead\\r , bodies--the cap, the noose, the pinioned arms, the faces that he knew,\\r , even beneath that hideous veil.--Light, light!\\r , \\r , At length, when his hands were raw with beating against the heavy door\\r , and walls, two men appeared:  one bearing a candle, which he thrust\\r , into an iron candlestick fixed against the wall:  the other dragging in\\r , a mattress on which to pass the night; for the prisoner was to be left\\r , alone no more.\\r , \\r , Then came the night--dark, dismal, silent night.  Other watchers are\\r , glad to hear this church-clock strike, for they tell of life and coming\\r , day.  To him they brought despair.  The boom of every iron bell came\\r , laden with the one, deep, hollow sound--Death. What availed the noise\\r , and bustle of cheerful morning, which penetrated even there, to him?\\r , It was another form of knell, with mockery added to the warning.\\r , \\r , The day passed off.  Day?  There was no day; it was gone as soon as\\r , come--and night came on again; night so long, and yet so short; long in\\r , its dreadful silence, and short in its fleeting hours.  At one time he\\r , raved and blasphemed; and at another howled and tore his hair.\\r , Venerable men of his own persuasion had come to pray beside him, but he\\r , had driven them away with curses.  They renewed their charitable\\r , efforts, and he beat them off.\\r , \\r , Saturday night.  He had only one night more to live.  And as he thought\\r , of this, the day broke--Sunday.\\r , \\r , It was not until the night of this last awful day, that a withering\\r , sense of his helpless, desperate state came in its full intensity upon\\r , his blighted soul; not that he had ever held any defined or positive\\r , hope of mercy, but that he had never been able to consider more than\\r , the dim probability of dying so soon. He had spoken little to either of\\r , the two men, who relieved each other in their attendance upon him; and\\r , they, for their parts, made no effort to rouse his attention.  He had\\r , sat there, awake, but dreaming.  Now, he started up, every minute, and\\r , with gasping mouth and burning skin, hurried to and fro, in such a\\r , paroxysm of fear and wrath that even they--used to such\\r , sights--recoiled from him with horror.  He grew so terrible, at last,\\r , in all the tortures of his evil conscience, that one man could not bear\\r , to sit there, eyeing him alone; and so the two kept watch together.\\r , \\r , He cowered down upon his stone bed, and thought of the past. He had\\r , been wounded with some missiles from the crowd on the day of his\\r , capture, and his head was bandaged with a linen cloth.  His red hair\\r , hung down upon his bloodless face; his beard was torn, and twisted into\\r , knots; his eyes shone with a terrible light; his unwashed flesh\\r , crackled with the fever that burnt him up. Eight--nine--then.  If it\\r , was not a trick to frighten him, and those were the real hours treading\\r , on each other\\'s heels, where would he be, when they came round again!\\r , Eleven!  Another struck, before the voice of the previous hour had\\r , ceased to vibrate.  At eight, he would be the only mourner in his own\\r , funeral train; at eleven--\\r , \\r , Those dreadful walls of Newgate, which have hidden so much misery and\\r , such unspeakable anguish, not only from the eyes, but, too often, and\\r , too long, from the thoughts, of men, never held so dread a spectacle as\\r , that.  The few who lingered as they passed, and wondered what the man\\r , was doing who was to be hanged to-morrow, would have slept but ill that\\r , night, if they could have seen him.\\r , \\r , From early in the evening until nearly midnight, little groups of two\\r , and three presented themselves at the lodge-gate, and inquired, with\\r , anxious faces, whether any reprieve had been received.  These being\\r , answered in the negative, communicated the welcome intelligence to\\r , clusters in the street, who pointed out to one another the door from\\r , which he must come out, and showed where the scaffold would be built,\\r , and, walking with unwilling steps away, turned back to conjure up the\\r , scene.  By degrees they fell off, one by one; and, for an hour, in the\\r , dead of night, the street was left to solitude and darkness.\\r , \\r , The space before the prison was cleared, and a few strong barriers,\\r , painted black, had been already thrown across the road to break the\\r , pressure of the expected crowd, when Mr. Brownlow and Oliver appeared\\r , at the wicket, and presented an order of admission to the prisoner,\\r , signed by one of the sheriffs.  They were immediately admitted into the\\r , lodge.\\r , \\r , \\'Is the young gentleman to come too, sir?\\' said the man whose duty it\\r , was to conduct them.  \\'It\\'s not a sight for children, sir.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It is not indeed, my friend,\\' rejoined Mr. Brownlow; \\'but my business\\r , with this man is intimately connected with him; and as this child has\\r , seen him in the full career of his success and villainy, I think it as\\r , well--even at the cost of some pain and fear--that he should see him\\r , now.\\'\\r , \\r , These few words had been said apart, so as to be inaudible to Oliver.\\r , The man touched his hat; and glancing at Oliver with some curiousity,\\r , opened another gate, opposite to that by which they had entered, and\\r , led them on, through dark and winding ways, towards the cells.\\r , \\r , \\'This,\\' said the man, stopping in a gloomy passage where a couple of\\r , workmen were making some preparations in profound silence--\\'this is the\\r , place he passes through.  If you step this way, you can see the door he\\r , goes out at.\\'\\r , \\r , He led them into a stone kitchen, fitted with coppers for dressing the\\r , prison food, and pointed to a door.  There was an open grating above\\r , it, through which came the sound of men\\'s voices, mingled with the\\r , noise of hammering, and the throwing down of boards.  They were\\r , putting up the scaffold.\\r , \\r , From this place, they passed through several strong gates, opened by\\r , other turnkeys from the inner side; and, having entered an open yard,\\r , ascended a flight of narrow steps, and came into a passage with a row\\r , of strong doors on the left hand.  Motioning them to remain where they\\r , were, the turnkey knocked at one of these with his bunch of keys. The\\r , two attendants, after a little whispering, came out into the passage,\\r , stretching themselves as if glad of the temporary relief, and motioned\\r , the visitors to follow the jailer into the cell.  They did so.\\r , \\r , The condemned criminal was seated on his bed, rocking himself from side\\r , to side, with a countenance more like that of a snared beast than the\\r , face of a man.  His mind was evidently wandering to his old life, for\\r , he continued to mutter, without appearing conscious of their presence\\r , otherwise than as a part of his vision.\\r , \\r , \\'Good boy, Charley--well done--\\' he mumbled.  \\'Oliver, too, ha! ha! ha!\\r , Oliver too--quite the gentleman now--quite the--take that boy away to\\r , bed!\\'\\r , \\r , The jailer took the disengaged hand of Oliver; and, whispering him not\\r , to be alarmed, looked on without speaking.\\r , \\r , \\'Take him away to bed!\\' cried Fagin.  \\'Do you hear me, some of you?  He\\r , has been the--the--somehow the cause of all this.  It\\'s worth the money\\r , to bring him up to it--Bolter\\'s throat, Bill; never mind the\\r , girl--Bolter\\'s throat as deep as you can cut.  Saw his head off!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Fagin,\\' said the jailer.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s me!\\' cried the Jew, falling instantly, into the attitude of\\r , listening he had assumed upon his trial.  \\'An old man, my Lord; a very\\r , old, old man!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Here,\\' said the turnkey, laying his hand upon his breast to keep him\\r , down.  \\'Here\\'s somebody wants to see you, to ask you some questions, I\\r , suppose.  Fagin, Fagin!  Are you a man?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I shan\\'t be one long,\\' he replied, looking up with a face retaining no\\r , human expression but rage and terror.  \\'Strike them all dead!  What\\r , right have they to butcher me?\\'\\r , \\r , As he spoke he caught sight of Oliver and Mr. Brownlow. Shrinking to\\r , the furthest corner of the seat, he demanded to know what they wanted\\r , there.\\r , \\r , \\'Steady,\\' said the turnkey, still holding him down.  \\'Now, sir, tell\\r , him what you want.  Quick, if you please, for he grows worse as the\\r , time gets on.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'You have some papers,\\' said Mr. Brownlow advancing, \\'which were placed\\r , in your hands, for better security, by a man called Monks.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'It\\'s all a lie together,\\' replied Fagin.  \\'I haven\\'t one--not one.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'For the love of God,\\' said Mr. Brownlow solemnly, \\'do not say that\\r , now, upon the very verge of death; but tell me where they are.  You\\r , know that Sikes is dead; that Monks has confessed; that there is no\\r , hope of any further gain.  Where are those papers?\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oliver,\\' cried Fagin, beckoning to him.  \\'Here, here! Let me whisper\\r , to you.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'I am not afraid,\\' said Oliver in a low voice, as he relinquished Mr.\\r , Brownlow\\'s hand.\\r , \\r , \\'The papers,\\' said Fagin, drawing Oliver towards him, \\'are in a canvas\\r , bag, in a hole a little way up the chimney in the top front-room.  I\\r , want to talk to you, my dear.  I want to talk to you.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Yes, yes,\\' returned Oliver.  \\'Let me say a prayer.  Do!  Let me say\\r , one prayer.  Say only one, upon your knees, with me, and we will talk\\r , till morning.\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Outside, outside,\\' replied Fagin, pushing the boy before him towards\\r , the door, and looking vacantly over his head. \\'Say I\\'ve gone to\\r , sleep--they\\'ll believe you.  You can get me out, if you take me so.\\r , Now then, now then!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Oh!  God forgive this wretched man!\\' cried the boy with a burst of\\r , tears.\\r , \\r , \\'That\\'s right, that\\'s right,\\' said Fagin.  \\'That\\'ll help us on. This\\r , door first.  If I shake and tremble, as we pass the gallows, don\\'t you\\r , mind, but hurry on.  Now, now, now!\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Have you nothing else to ask him, sir?\\' inquired the turnkey.\\r , \\r , \\'No other question,\\' replied Mr. Brownlow.  \\'If I hoped we could recall\\r , him to a sense of his position--\\'\\r , \\r , \\'Nothing will do that, sir,\\' replied the man, shaking his head. \\'You\\r , had better leave him.\\'\\r , \\r , The door of the cell opened, and the attendants returned.\\r , \\r , \\'Press on, press on,\\' cried Fagin.  \\'Softly, but not so slow. Faster,\\r , faster!\\'\\r , \\r , The men laid hands upon him, and disengaging Oliver from his grasp,\\r , held him back.  He struggled with the power of desperation, for an\\r , instant; and then sent up cry upon cry that penetrated even those\\r , massive walls, and rang in their ears until they reached the open yard.\\r , \\r , It was some time before they left the prison.  Oliver nearly swooned\\r , after this frightful scene, and was so weak that for an hour or more,\\r , he had not the strength to walk.\\r , \\r , Day was dawning when they again emerged.  A great multitude had already\\r , assembled; the windows were filled with people, smoking and playing\\r , cards to beguile the time; the crowd were pushing, quarrelling, joking.\\r , Everything told of life and animation, but one dark cluster of objects\\r , in the centre of all--the black stage, the cross-beam, the rope, and\\r , all the hideous apparatus of death.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , CHAPTER LIII\\r , \\r , AND LAST\\r , \\r , The fortunes of those who have figured in this tale are nearly closed.\\r , The little that remains to their historian to relate, is told in few\\r , and simple words.\\r , \\r , Before three months had passed, Rose Fleming and Harry Maylie were\\r , married in the village church which was henceforth to be the scene of\\r , the young clergyman\\'s labours; on the same day they entered into\\r , possession of their new and happy home.\\r , \\r , Mrs. Maylie took up her abode with her son and daughter-in-law, to\\r , enjoy, during the tranquil remainder of her days, the greatest felicity\\r , that age and worth can know--the contemplation of the happiness of\\r , those on whom the warmest affections and tenderest cares of a\\r , well-spent life, have been unceasingly bestowed.\\r , \\r , It appeared, on full and careful investigation, that if the wreck of\\r , property remaining in the custody of Monks (which had never prospered\\r , either in his hands or in those of his mother) were equally divided\\r , between himself and Oliver, it would yield, to each, little more than\\r , three thousand pounds.  By the provisions of his father\\'s will, Oliver\\r , would have been entitled to the whole; but Mr. Brownlow, unwilling to\\r , deprive the elder son of the opportunity of retrieving his former vices\\r , and pursuing an honest career, proposed this mode of distribution, to\\r , which his young charge joyfully acceded.\\r , \\r , Monks, still bearing that assumed name, retired with his portion to a\\r , distant part of the New World; where, having quickly squandered it, he\\r , once more fell into his old courses, and, after undergoing a long\\r , confinement for some fresh act of fraud and knavery, at length sunk\\r , under an attack of his old disorder, and died in prison.  As far from\\r , home, died the chief remaining members of his friend Fagin\\'s gang.\\r , \\r , Mr. Brownlow adopted Oliver as his son.  Removing with him and the old\\r , housekeeper to within a mile of the parsonage-house, where his dear\\r , friends resided, he gratified the only remaining wish of Oliver\\'s warm\\r , and earnest heart, and thus linked together a little society, whose\\r , condition approached as nearly to one of perfect happiness as can ever\\r , be known in this changing world.\\r , \\r , Soon after the marriage of the young people, the worthy doctor returned\\r , to Chertsey, where, bereft of the presence of his old friends, he would\\r , have been discontented if his temperament had admitted of such a\\r , feeling; and would have turned quite peevish if he had known how.  For\\r , two or three months, he contented himself with hinting that he feared\\r , the air began to disagree with him; then, finding that the place really\\r , no longer was, to him, what it had been, he settled his business on his\\r , assistant, took a bachelor\\'s cottage outside the village of which his\\r , young friend was pastor, and instantaneously recovered.  Here he took\\r , to gardening, planting, fishing, carpentering, and various other\\r , pursuits of a similar kind:  all undertaken with his characteristic\\r , impetuosity.  In each and all he has since become famous throughout the\\r , neighborhood, as a most profound authority.\\r , \\r , Before his removal, he had managed to contract a strong friendship for\\r , Mr. Grimwig, which that eccentric gentleman cordially reciprocated.  He\\r , is accordingly visited by Mr. Grimwig a great many times in the course\\r , of the year.  On all such occasions, Mr. Grimwig plants, fishes, and\\r , carpenters, with great ardour; doing everything in a very singular and\\r , unprecedented manner, but always maintaining with his favourite\\r , asseveration, that his mode is the right one.  On Sundays, he never\\r , fails to criticise the sermon to the young clergyman\\'s face:  always\\r , informing Mr. Losberne, in strict confidence afterwards, that he\\r , considers it an excellent performance, but deems it as well not to say\\r , so.  It is a standing and very favourite joke, for Mr. Brownlow to\\r , rally him on his old prophecy concerning Oliver, and to remind him of\\r , the night on which they sat with the watch between them, waiting his\\r , return; but Mr. Grimwig contends that he was right in the main, and, in\\r , proof thereof, remarks that Oliver did not come back after all; which\\r , always calls forth a laugh on his side, and increases his good humour.\\r , \\r , Mr. Noah Claypole:  receiving a free pardon from the Crown in\\r , consequence of being admitted approver against Fagin:  and considering\\r , his profession not altogether as safe a one as he could wish:  was, for\\r , some little time, at a loss for the means of a livelihood, not burdened\\r , with too much work.  After some consideration, he went into business as\\r , an informer, in which calling he realises a genteel subsistence.  His\\r , plan is, to walk out once a week during church time attended by\\r , Charlotte in respectable attire.  The lady faints away at the doors of\\r , charitable publicans, and the gentleman being accommodated with\\r , three-penny worth of brandy to restore her, lays an information next\\r , day, and pockets half the penalty.  Sometimes Mr. Claypole faints\\r , himself, but the result is the same.\\r , \\r , Mr. and Mrs. Bumble, deprived of their situations, were gradually\\r , reduced to great indigence and misery, and finally became paupers in\\r , that very same workhouse in which they had once lorded it over others.\\r , Mr. Bumble has been heard to say, that in this reverse and degradation,\\r , he has not even spirits to be thankful for being separated from his\\r , wife.\\r , \\r , As to Mr. Giles and Brittles, they still remain in their old posts,\\r , although the former is bald, and the last-named boy quite grey.  They\\r , sleep at the parsonage, but divide their attentions so equally among\\r , its inmates, and Oliver and Mr. Brownlow, and Mr. Losberne, that to\\r , this day the villagers have never been able to discover to which\\r , establishment they properly belong.\\r , \\r , Master Charles Bates, appalled by Sikes\\'s crime, fell into a train of\\r , reflection whether an honest life was not, after all, the best.\\r , Arriving at the conclusion that it certainly was, he turned his back\\r , upon the scenes of the past, resolved to amend it in some new sphere of\\r , action.  He struggled hard, and suffered much, for some time; but,\\r , having a contented disposition, and a good purpose, succeeded in the\\r , end; and, from being a farmer\\'s drudge, and a carrier\\'s lad, he is now\\r , the merriest young grazier in all Northamptonshire.\\r , \\r , And now, the hand that traces these words, falters, as it approaches\\r , the conclusion of its task; and would weave, for a little longer space,\\r , the thread of these adventures.\\r , \\r , I would fain linger yet with a few of those among whom I have so long\\r , moved, and share their happiness by endeavouring to depict it.  I would\\r , show Rose Maylie in all the bloom and grace of early womanhood,\\r , shedding on her secluded path in life soft and gentle light, that fell\\r , on all who trod it with her, and shone into their hearts.  I would\\r , paint her the life and joy of the fire-side circle and the lively\\r , summer group; I would follow her through the sultry fields at noon, and\\r , hear the low tones of her sweet voice in the moonlit evening walk; I\\r , would watch her in all her goodness and charity abroad, and the smiling\\r , untiring discharge of domestic duties at home; I would paint her and\\r , her dead sister\\'s child happy in their love for one another, and\\r , passing whole hours together in picturing the friends whom they had so\\r , sadly lost; I would summon before me, once again, those joyous little\\r , faces that clustered round her knee, and listen to their merry prattle;\\r , I would recall the tones of that clear laugh, and conjure up the\\r , sympathising tear that glistened in the soft blue eye.  These, and a\\r , thousand looks and smiles, and turns of thought and speech--I would\\r , fain recall them every one.\\r , \\r , How Mr. Brownlow went on, from day to day, filling the mind of his\\r , adopted child with stores of knowledge, and becoming attached to him,\\r , more and more, as his nature developed itself, and showed the thriving\\r , seeds of all he wished him to become--how he traced in him new traits\\r , of his early friend, that awakened in his own bosom old remembrances,\\r , melancholy and yet sweet and soothing--how the two orphans, tried by\\r , adversity, remembered its lessons in mercy to others, and mutual love,\\r , and fervent thanks to Him who had protected and preserved them--these\\r , are all matters which need not to be told.  I have said that they were\\r , truly happy; and without strong affection and humanity of heart, and\\r , gratitude to that Being whose code is Mercy, and whose great attribute\\r , is Benevolence to all things that breathe, happiness can never be\\r , attained.\\r , \\r , Within the altar of the old village church there stands a white marble\\r , tablet, which bears as yet but one word:  \\'AGNES.\\'  There is no coffin\\r , in that tomb; and may it be many, many years, before another name is\\r , placed above it!  But, if the spirits of the Dead ever come back to\\r , earth, to visit spots hallowed by the love--the love beyond the\\r , grave--of those whom they knew in life, I believe that the shade of\\r , Agnes sometimes hovers round that solemn nook. I believe it none the\\r , less because that nook is in a Church, and she was weak and erring.\\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , \\r , \\r '"
